# Cindy Design System

> Heritage note: this visual language was originally derived from an external
> minimalist reference (2025). It has since evolved into Cindy's own system —
> no external site or product is a reference for new design decisions.

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Cindy's interface is radical minimalism applied to an AI-agent workbench — a quiet, near-monochrome canvas where the user's content and the agent's output are the only things that demand attention. The design philosophy mirrors the product: strip away everything unnecessary until only the essential tool remains. This is the digital equivalent of a Dieter Rams object — every pixel earns its place, and the absence of decoration IS the design.

The default theme lives almost entirely in grayscale. Chromatic color is reserved for a small, explicitly sanctioned set of semantic signals (status, diff, focus — see §2); everything else is shades between near-black and near-white. Long working sessions stay calm, and color means something whenever it does appear.

What makes this system distinctive is the combination of a single geometric sans-serif (Inter) with a pill-first geometry (ordinary action frames default to pills; registered shapes and contained content are assigned separately under §5). The clean letterforms + rounded buttons + rounded containers create a cohesive "softness language" that makes a developer-oriented tool feel approachable and friendly rather than intimidating. This is minimalism with warmth — not cold Swiss-style grid minimalism, but the kind where the edges are literally softened.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Near-monochrome default theme; chromatic color only via the sanctioned semantic set (§2), always consumed through tokens (§10)
- Inter as the single sans family, carrying both display headlines and body text
- Tight border-radius system (§5): 0px / 2px (registered data marks) / 4px (keyboard keycaps) / 8px (inner controls) / 12px (containers) / 9999px (pill frames)
- Zero shadows in the base language — depth comes from background color shifts and 1px borders (narrow token-gated exceptions live in §10)
- Ordinary action frames default to pills; registered shapes (keycaps and data marks) and contained content are handled as separate visible layers. Apply §5 Step 1 before the Step 2 control tiers, including the inner-control tier for textareas.
- No mascots or decorative artwork in the working UI — brand imagery appears only on sanctioned brand surfaces (see §15.7 / §16)
- Extreme content restraint — each surface presents one clear idea

### 1.1 New-task home content (user decision, 2026-09-06)

The new-task home does not display the inherited-subscription or promotional-credit
notice cards. With a usable model, the composer is followed by suggestion rows;
the existing zero-model action remains available when no model can be used.
Subscription details belong in provider settings, and credit balances and expiry
details remain in billing settings.

Removing these two cards is an explicit product decision, including for users who
have not dismissed them. Do not restore them or move them to another automatic
notice surface merely to preserve their former one-time-notification behavior.
The decision and review correction are recorded in
[`design-decision-log.md`](./design-decision-log.md) (2026-09-06).

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

> **Multi-theme note**: the values in this section are the concrete **Default Light / Default Dark** (base theme) palette, given as the visual-spec reference sample. At runtime **every color is consumed through a token** (see §10 Theme System & Token Reference), so the same component automatically renders each theme's own colors under other themes (Eclipse / One Dark Pro / Monokai Pro, …). **When implementing components, always write tokens, never hex** — rules in §10.

### Primary Text

- **Pure Black** (`#000000`): Primary headlines, primary links, and the darkest text in Light Mode. The only "color" that demands attention. **Never used as a background** — reserved exclusively for text and icons.
- **Near Black** (`#262626`): Button text on light-colored surfaces, secondary headline weight.

### Layer System (Light & Dark)

The interface is built from a three-tier layer system that applies symmetrically to both modes — **Surface** as the base, **Card** as the elevated layer, and **Board** as the hairline divider. This is the foundation of every page in every mode.

| Role        | Light Mode | Dark Mode | Usage                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Surface** | `#f8f8f6`  | `#1f1f1e` | The primary page background — every page starts here. In full-window app layouts, this is the single flat background. In centered-card layouts, this is the page beneath the card. |
| **Card**    | `#ffffff`  | `#2c2c2a` | The elevated layer sitting on top of Surface — login cards, modals, panels, raised containers, and any element that needs to visually lift off the page.                           |
| **Board**   | `#d7d7d4`  | `#3c3c3a` | The hairline divider color — 1px borders between sections, card outlines, and any separator line within the same layer.                                                            |

**Layer rule — flat vs. elevated:**

- **Full-window applications** (e.g. main workspace, chat interface, dashboards): use **Surface** as a single flat background for the entire window — no Card layer at the page-structure level. Section boundaries (sidebar, toolbar, content area) are drawn with 1px **Board** dividers, never with background color shifts.
- **Centered-card layouts** (e.g. login, modal, empty-state card on a blank page): use **Surface** as the page background and **Card** as the lifted card. The color difference between Surface and Card is what makes the card read as "lifted" — no shadow needed. The card outline is drawn in **Board**.

> **Important — element-level vs. page-level:** The "flat Surface" rule in full-window layouts applies only to the **overall page structure**, not to individual widgets. Lifted widgets _within_ a full-window layout — inputs, chat input boxes, raised cards, modal overlays, panel popups — still use **Card** color per their component rules (see Section 4). A full-window chat interface can have a flat Surface page _and_ a Card-colored chat input box at the same time; those are two different scopes. "Surface flat" means "don't split the page into Page+Card layers," not "every element on the page must be Surface color."

### Chip & Button Neutrals

Small interactive chips (button backgrounds, tag pills, avatar fills, selected-nav pills) sit outside the layer system — they're foreground elements, not background layers.

- **Light Gray** (`#e5e5e5`): Chip/button backgrounds in Light Mode — the workhorse neutral for pressed states, filled pills, tag backgrounds, and avatar fills.
- **Dark Chip** (`#3c3c3a`, token `--surface-chip`): the primary chip/button background in Dark Mode — one step lifted above a Card or Surface context.
- **Dark Chip Alt** (`#2c2c2a`, token `--surface-chip-alt`): the variant that collapses to the Dark Card value — used where a chip sits directly on Surface and only needs the Card-level lift. When in doubt, use `--surface-chip`; see §10 for both slots.

> ~~**Border Light** (`#d4d4d4`)~~ — deprecated (2026-06, G2). Once labeled the "white-button border color", but no real component ever used it (only bare hardcodes in the experimental view). White Pill secondary borders uniformly use **Board** (`--border-default` `#d7d7d4`).

### Neutrals & Text

- **Stone** (`#737373`): Secondary body text, footer links, and de-emphasized content. The primary "muted" tone.
- **Mid Gray** (`#525252`): Emphasized secondary text, slightly darker than Stone.
- **Silver** (`#a3a3a3`): Tertiary text and deeply de-emphasized metadata. **Never use it as a placeholder** — too prominent, reads as filled-in (see §4 Inputs; the G3 erratum is archived in [`design-decision-log.md`](./design-decision-log.md); placeholders use `--text-placeholder` `#c4c4c4`).

> ~~**Button Text Dark** (`#404040`)~~ — deprecated (2026-06, G1). Once labeled the "white-surface button text color", but no real button ever used it (only bare hardcodes in the experimental view). White Pill secondary text uniformly uses **Near Black** (`--text-primary` `#262626`).

### Semantic & Accent

The grayscale rule is near-absolute. The following are the **only** sanctioned non-gray colors in the system — each tightly scoped to a specific surface. New semantic colors must not be introduced without being recorded here first.

- **Focus Blue** (`#417CDD` at 50%; tokens `--focus-ring` / `--focus-ring-soft`): the keyboard-accessibility focus ring, finalized 2026-07-17 (replaces Tailwind's default `#3b82f6`). Never visible in normal interaction flow.
- **Thinking / Warning Orange** (`#EA6B17`, finalized 2026-07-17, replaces the frozen `#FF6600`): the shared warning-accent family, identical in both modes. Sanctioned consumers only — the ChatView Running Status Bar (sparkles icon + status text, e.g. `Spelunking...`, no background fill), running-state breathing icons in the sidebar, the collaboration-mode menu row's ON state, the plan-approve icon, the Full Access permission highlight, the settings integration warning, and the workflow agent status strip's running cells (8×8px filled squares in the background-tasks panel detail and the workflow chat card, registered 2026-07-28 — running-state semantics, same family as the sidebar breathing icons; the done/failed/queued cells stay on their own semantic tokens: `--card-status-done` / `--error-fg` / `--surface-chip`), and the sidebar task-info PR unresolved corner dot (registered 2026-08-17 — same `--status-bar-accent` as the session-header unresolved count; static, no breathing) (see the §10 exemption table and §15 for the full token list: `--warning-accent` and its follower tokens). A consumer that introduces no new token — one that reads `--warning-accent` or an existing follower directly, like this strip — is registered by this list alone; a consumer needing a NEW token must be registered in the §10 exemption table first.

> **Additional narrowly-scoped exceptions** (documented in their respective component specs, do NOT generalize as system semantic colors):
>
> - **Windows taskbar attention badge** — the native OS overlay uses a fixed red background (`#D91F37`) and white digits/border (`#FFFFFF`) in both Light and Dark taskbars. This is the app-wide count of active tasks needing attention, not an error-only status. The image-specific semantic pair lives in `apps/desktop/src/main/windowsBadgeIcon.ts`; it is not an in-app theme token. Render at 16 logical pixels with 100/125/150/200/300% representations; use a circle for one digit, a rounded square for multiple digits, and `99+` above 99. The accessibility description keeps the exact total. Only the OS image may use its fitted 8–12px system-font digits; web typography and status-dot color rules are unchanged.
> - **Toast Info / Success / Warning / Error** — `#417CDD` / `#2AAE5B` / `#F3A115` / `#D91F37`(finalized 2026-07-17; Toast exemption lifted) — used ONLY on the 16×16 lucide icon inside Toast pill notifications. The pill body (background, text, border, close icon) remains strictly grayscale. Info blue #417CDD equals the focus-ring / Auto Approval value (originally #3B82F6, added 2026-07-14, now finalized); success/warning/error equal the global status colors (done green / status error / warning foreground).
> - **Usage History category color (owner-approved 2026-09-08, extended 2026-09-09).** The registered usage heatmap uses a blue intensity scale. Daily token bars and their corresponding model-table swatches/share marks use `--usage-model-1` … `--usage-model-5` as the seed palette; additional models receive theme-derived hues without a top-five cutoff. All model identities in the full history are included, even when absent from the last 30 days. Agent/harness swatches, share marks and the stacked share strip reuse the existing engine identity tokens: `--engine-badge-cc` (terracotta orange), `--engine-badge-codex` (blue), and `--usage-model-1` (owner-chosen teal for pi, to distinguish it from Codex blue). Claude/Codex retain their cross-mode fixed-value contract; pi follows the existing Light/Dark teal values. `--usage-heatmap-high` supplies the high end of the heatmap. The heatmap retains its process-blue alias; category colors do not inherit process/status semantics. Task marks, text and control frames stay neutral. See [the component specification](./usage-history-charts.md); colors.ts remains the seed-value source, with runtime derivation under governance §3.4.
> - **Resource Usage Process Categories** — the Resource Usage table may color only its 14px process-type glyphs so dense rows can be scanned by category (user-requested 2026-08-06). The six category pairs are task Agent blue `#2563EB / #60A5FA`, Agent service purple `#7C3AED / #A78BFA`, main-process pink `#DB2777 / #F472B6`, renderer cyan `#0891B2 / #22D3EE`, GPU amber `#D97706 / #F59E0B`, and utility green `#059669 / #34D399` (Light / Dark). These colors encode process category, **not health or status**; row backgrounds, labels, metrics, selection and actions remain on the neutral system. Direct use is confined to `resource-usage` process glyphs; the explicitly registered Usage History heatmap alias above may also reference the task-blue value. No other table or process UI inherits this permission. Tokens: `--process-agent-task-icon`, `--process-agent-service-icon`, `--process-main-icon`, `--process-renderer-icon`, `--process-gpu-icon`, `--process-utility-icon`.
> - **Bot Avatar Hues** — the Bots feature may fill a Bot's round avatar with one of nine registered tints so a list of persistent assistants can be told apart at a glance (registered 2026-08-17). The hue encodes **which Bot this is** — an identity cue like the file-type badges above, never health, status, or channel. Light mode uses soft tints, Dark mode the matching deep tints; the emoji and the initial-letter fallback (always `--text-primary`) stay legible in both. Tokens: `--bot-avatar-red-bg` / `-orange-` / `-amber-` / `-green-` / `-teal-` / `-blue-` / `-violet-` / `-pink-` / `-graphite-bg` (the last is the neutral step, and is where legacy `graphite` avatar data lands). Scope is strictly the Bot avatar fill in `features/bots` — do not reuse these tints for status dots, badges, row backgrounds, or any other surface. External theme import never touches them (the import template is allow-list only), so Bot identity colors do not drift between themes.
> - **Bot Unread Badge** — the Bots sidebar may paint its unread pill and its pending-todo dot in information blue `#417CDD` with white text (registered 2026-08-19). The color encodes **IM unread semantics** ("how much have I not seen"), the one signal every chat list has taught users to read by color alone; it is not a CTA and not a health/status tone. The pill was previously the inverse-CTA fill, which on the selected row's light-gray pill turned into two high-contrast marks competing for the same glance. Same value both modes — an unread count means the same thing in Light and Dark, and the value is already the registered focus-ring / Auto Approval / Toast-info blue. The foreground is a standalone white: `--accent-pure-cta-fg` flips to black in Dark and cannot be borrowed. Tokens: `--bot-unread-bg` / `--bot-unread-fg`. Scope is strictly the teammate-list unread badge and the pending-todo dot in `features/bots/BotsSidebar.tsx` — do not reuse it for other badges, status dots, row backgrounds, or any other surface.
> - **ConfirmDialog Danger** — `#EF4444` used ONLY on the confirm button background in the Danger variant. The cancel button and rest of the dialog remain grayscale.
> - **Permission Selector Mode Highlights** — selected risky permission modes may color only the option text/icon/checkmark and the collapsed trigger text/icon. The selected row background remains grayscale. Auto Approval uses `#417CDD` in both modes (finalized 2026-07-17, same value light/dark; replaces light #000050 / dark #00D9C5). Full Access uses Heart Orange `#EA6B17` in both modes (auto-follows warning-accent, finalized 2026-07-17). These hex values are the **default-theme palette only** — other themes may override `--perm-auto-selected-text` and `--perm-bypass-selected-text` with their own accent colors, provided both modes remain color-coded, distinguishable from each other, and visually distinct from neutral text. Tokens: `--perm-auto-selected-text` and `--perm-bypass-selected-text` in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/styles/globals.css`.
> - **Diff Add Green / Diff Del Red** — GitHub-standard diff syntax colors, used on the `+` / `-` symbol glyph, the changed-line text foreground, **and the full row background** inside code-diff renderings. Applied in three places: (1) the Edit-tool DiffView card (F-MSG-6), (2) markdown ````diff`fenced code blocks in the message stream, and (3)`.diff`/`.patch`files opened in TextLightbox (the document previewer) — there hljs`.hljs-addition`/`.hljs-deletion`are forced`display: block`so the background fills to the right edge instead of stopping at the last glyph. Line-number gutter and ctx (unchanged) lines remain strictly grayscale per the layer system. **Foreground** — Add:`#22863a`Light /`#7ee787`Dark; Del:`#b31d28`Light /`#ff7b72`Dark. **Background** — Add:`#f0fff4`Light /`#033a16`Dark; Del:`#ffeef0`Light /`#67060c`Dark. Tokens:`--diff-add-fg/-bg`and`--diff-del-fg/-bg`in`apps/desktop/src/renderer/styles/globals.css`. Updated 2026-04-21: backgrounds switched from grayscale → GitHub red/green for full-row fill so additions / deletions are unambiguous at a glance.
> - **PR Status Colors (session-git-pr-context / sidebar task-info)** — closed = `--error-fg`, merged = `--focus-ring`, draft = `--text-tertiary` (single source: `PR_STATUS_COLOR` in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/features/cc-agent/gitContextPrVisuals.ts`). **Open green is split:** the session-header GitContextBadge and sidebar hover tooltip keep `--diff-add-fg` (theme-following GitHub greens). The sidebar task-info icon (registered 2026-08-17) follows the **surface**, not the theme name: it reads HSL lightness of `--sidebar` / `--sidebar-item-active` (Cindy's selected pill is inverse; many community/imported themes are not). Light surfaces use `--pr-open-on-light` `#2EA043`; dark surfaces use `--pr-open-on-dark` `#3FB950`. Both values are theme-invariant. The `#number` stays on the info-slot foreground. Open/draft PRs with `unresolvedCount > 0` add a 5px static `--status-bar-accent` corner dot on the status icon (not an AttentionDot tone). Unknown/unloaded status degrades to `--text-tertiary`. Scope is strictly PR-state surfaces; do not generalize these colors to other status systems.

_Dark Mode text uses softened neutrals to reduce eye strain: **Soft Gray** (`#d4d4d4`) for primary text, **Silver** (`#a3a3a3`) for secondary, **Stone** (`#737373`) for tertiary (per `--text-secondary` / `--text-tertiary` in `colors.ts` — the two swap between modes). Pure White (`#ffffff`) is reserved for button labels and high-contrast UI elements on dark backgrounds._

### Gradient System

- **None in the core UI.** Cindy uses no gradients; visual separation comes from flat color blocks and single-pixel borders. This is a deliberate, almost philosophical design choice. (The login canvas is also flat by ruling — see §16.5.)
- **Session-loading wordmark sheen — narrow functional exception (Desktop approved 2026-08-10).** `BrandLoadingMark` may use one neutral `transparent → --text-primary → transparent` gradient solely as a mask-clipped highlight inside the official Light/Dark wordmark while a session's message tree is deferred. It is a loading-progress signal, not a background, separator, fill, or reusable surface treatment. It may appear only after the 200ms delayed-reveal threshold, disappears as soon as the message tree mounts, and may not leak to messages, cards, dialogs, sidebars, or static branding. Full motion and brand-surface constraints are registered in §14.4 and §15.7.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family

- **Display / Body / UI**: `Inter`, with fallbacks: `system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", sans-serif`
- **Monospace**: `JetBrains Mono`, with fallbacks: `ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, monospace`

> Desktop default clarification: JetBrains Mono below is an optional preset and a historical typography sample. The shipped default uses the system monospace stack from `reference/foundations.json` → `app-font-code-default`, with the existing CJK fallbacks. DS-8 preserves that stack and user font selection; see [the recorded decision](./design-decision-log.md#2026-09-11-ds-8-默认代码字体依据迁移).

_Note: The entire interface uses a single sans font — Inter — for both display headlines and body text. Inter is chosen for (a) its neutral, geometric character that stays out of the way, (b) its excellent legibility at small sizes, and (c) its wide availability in both web and design tooling. A single font keeps the hierarchy clean — separation comes from size and weight, not typeface contrast._

### Hierarchy

_Positioning note: the Display / Section Heading / Sub-heading rows are conceptual role targets for **brand canvases only** (the §16 login / splash family and its self-contained pages). Their concrete values live in canvas constants and §16 tables, not in app code. The 「排版豁免登记表」 below only registers exemption domains. Everything else — everyday chrome **and** in-app empty states — lives in the Body / Caption / Small / Micro rows, and for `apps/desktop` code the normative size set is the 「桌面 UI 字号白名单」 below: this table describes roles, the whitelist constrains values._

### Principles

- **Single sans family**: Inter carries both display headlines and body text — no typeface switching between hierarchy levels. Size and weight alone create hierarchy, keeping the typographic system maximally simple.
- **Weight restraint**: Everyday chrome defaults to 400 (regular) and 500 (medium); 600 is a rationed emphasis tier, and 700 lives exclusively inside registered exemption domains. No light, no black weight, no in-between values. The full ladder and its rules are in 「字重阶梯」 below (2026-08 revision, issue #1505 — this supersedes the former "400/500 only" wording).
- **Tight display, comfortable body**: Headlines compress to 1.0 line-height, while body text relaxes to 1.43–1.56. The contrast creates clear hierarchy without needing weight contrast.
- **Monospace for code only**: JetBrains Mono is reserved for inline code, terminal commands, and code blocks — never used for UI chrome.

### 字重阶梯(2026-08 修订,issue #1505)

全站字重只允许以下四档整百值,禁止一切中间值(550/650…)与 800 及以上:

| 档  | 名称     | 用途                                                                        |
| --- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400 | Regular  | 长文阅读正文、代码                                                          |
| 500 | Medium   | UI 默认强调、标题 —— 日常 chrome 的主力档                                   |
| 600 | Semibold | 限量强调(徽标、表头、选中态等局部加重)。新增使用要能说出「为什么 500 不够」 |
| 700 | Bold     | **仅限下方豁免登记表中的域**,禁止出现在普通 UI chrome                       |

- 与手机端 `apps/mobile/src/theme/tokens.ts` 的 `fontWeight` token(regular / medium / semibold / bold)一一对应 —— 两端一张梯子。
- **两端 700 口径**:手机端 UI chrome 的上限仍是 600（正本为 `apps/mobile/docs/mobile-design-guide.md`,该文已同步登记本例外）。`bold` / 700 在手机端**只允许**出现在下表登记的域——原生 Markdown strong 与登录品牌画布。也就是说「四档梯子」是两端共用的**档位定义**,不等于两端 chrome 都可用 700。
- **CJK 注记**:桌面未设 `font-synthesis: none`,中文回退字体(PingFang)公开档位到 600 —— UI 里用 700 会在中文上触发伪粗体(算法加粗、边缘发糊),且 600 与 700 在 CJK 上的渲染差异不可靠。**中文层级不得依赖 600 vs 700 区分**,强调靠字号或颜色。

### 桌面 UI 字号白名单(2026-08,issue #1505)

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED DS-8: numeric-type -->
- **UI 段:{10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}px;标题 / 内容段:{18, 20, 24, 28}px。** 下限 10px —— 9px 及以下禁止(再小就不是文字是纹理)。
<!-- END GENERATED DS-8: numeric-type -->
- **下限约束的是「开发者写死的档位」,不约束运行期缩放结果。** 用户可把 UI 字号设到 `appearanceSettings.uiSize` 允许的最小值 12（默认 14）,`useFontSettings` 按 `uiSize / 14` 缩放并 `Math.round`,此时 `--text-10` 与 `--text-11` 都会算成 9px（两档在该设置下失去区分）。这是用户主动选择的整体缩小,不是违反下限;守卫也只检查源码里写的档位,不检查运行期计算值。**若要保住 10px 视觉下限,应在字号设置侧（提高 `uiSize` 下限或改缩放曲线）解决,而不是往白名单里加更小的档位。**
- **写法**:一律用 `tailwind.config.ts` 的 `text-<n>` token 类(映射 `--text-<n>` 变量;doc 紧凑模式与后续字号缩放能力都挂在这层变量上,任意值类会静默漏掉这些机制)。语义类 `text-xs / text-sm / text-base / text-lg` 只收编存量(等值 12 / 14 / 16 / 18)；源码侧禁止使用 `text-xl` 及以上语义档位（由守卫拦截），配置侧 `theme.extend.fontSize` 的 `xl..5xl` 遗留项不在本轮删除范围，避免删除后静默回退到 Tailwind 内置固定值、失去用户字号缩放；其清理另行处理。**禁止新增任意值 `text-[Npx]`(含一切小数)与白名单外档位**;需要新档先改本表与权威来源，再进组件。
- **单源约定（DS-8）**：DTCG 为已接管族的唯一编辑源；同一 Terrazzo 流程生成本节摘要、CSS 默认值及 Tailwind/字号 hook/class merge 的映射。`useFontSettings` 保留原缩放计算，shared 默认字号只引用无 DOM 的生成子集。生成新鲜度与独立白名单、实际缩放测试共同保护此链，不再手动同步多份数值。
- 品牌画布域(登录 / Splash 家族等设计 px 坐标系表面)不映射本白名单:字面量只允许进画布常量文件(`loginDesignTokens.ts` 的地位,对齐手机端 `loginSkinLayout.ts`)**或下表登记的自包含品牌页生成器**(`oauthResultPage.ts` 整页由 main 侧生成,其内嵌 raw CSS 即该页的常量载体),组件消费端照常受守卫扫描。

### 排版 non-goals(2026-08 登记)

以下漂移**已知且本轮明确不治理**,后人见到不要当「漏网」顺手修,治理需另立 issue:

- line-height **档位统一**:桌面存在 `leading-[1.45]` / `leading-[1.55]` 等微调档与无单位 / px 混轨,本轮不收敛成统一阶梯。
  - **但有一条例外,已在 #1553 治理完毕**:`text-<n>` 与**固定 px 行高**(`leading-[Mpx]`)并存属于**功能缺陷**,不是风格漂移 —— `text-<n>` 经 `--text-<n>` 响应「外观 → UI 字号」设置,固定 px 行框不跟随,用户放大字号时文字会裁切/重叠。原设计未考虑用户可自行调整字号,故留下这个洞。**该组合一律改为无单位比例**(比例 = 原 px ÷ 字号),渲染在默认字号下不变而放大时正确。#1553 已把当时全部 38 处清零(其中 14 处为字号归一新引入、24 处先于其存在);后续新增 `text-<n>` 时**不得再配固定 px 行高**,该约束由 `typographyDiscipline.test.ts` 的 `fixed-leading` 规则做机器门禁,**按 `className` / `cn(...)` 整块区域跨行判定**(只比对同一行会漏掉 `cn()` 分行写法,#1553 实际漏过一处)。行高被 JS 布局计算写死引用时(如按行高算 auto-grow 上限),须同时改成读计算值,否则上限不跟随缩放。
- 语义类 `text-xs/sm/base/lg` → `text-<n>` 的机械统一:等值改写零收益,收编即可。
- letter-spacing 与 font-family 治理。
- 原生层排版:macOS agent-island helper 等 Swift / 原生 UI 的字号字重不在本白名单域(Web 白名单与守卫均不覆盖,治理需另立 issue)。

## 4. Component Stylings

> Buttons / Cards / Inputs below use the structured key-value format (adopted from the §12 pilot, 2026-07): `field → token → Default Light / Default Dark resolved values`. Token names per §10.

### Buttons

```
button/primary  (Gray Pill)
  fill      --surface-chip        #e5e5e5 / #3c3c3a
  text      --text-primary        #262626 / #d4d4d4
  border    1px solid --surface-chip   (same as fill)
  radius    9999px (pill)
  padding   10px 24px
  height    32px (md) / 36px (lg) — no 40px size (DS-4 G1, 2026-09-03)
  type      text-13 / font-medium 500 (DS-4 G4, 2026-09-03)
  hover     --button-primary-hover     rest fill mixed 8% toward --text-primary   (swap-color, never opacity; DS-4 G2)
  pressed   --button-primary-pressed   hover mixed a further 10% toward --text-primary   (DS-4 G3)
  disabled  opacity 60%; ordinary pointer (#3246)
  note      understated, grayscale, always a pill
  impl      components/ui/button.tsx variant="primary"

button/secondary  (White Pill)
  fill      --surface-elevated    #ffffff / #2c2c2a
  text      --text-primary        #262626 / #d4d4d4
  border    --border-default      #d7d7d4 / #3c3c3a
  radius    9999px (pill)
  padding   10px 24px
  height    32px (md) / 36px (lg) — no 40px size (DS-4 G1)
  type      text-13 / font-medium 500 (DS-4 G4)
  hover     --button-secondary-hover    rest fill mixed 8% toward --text-primary
  pressed   --button-secondary-pressed  hover mixed a further 10% toward --text-primary
  disabled  opacity 60%; ordinary pointer
  note      visually lighter than primary; binds Tier-1, not --settings-btn-secondary-* (DS-4 G5)
  impl      components/ui/button.tsx variant="secondary"

button/cta  (Black Pill — maximum emphasis)
  fill      --accent-cta-bg-pure  #000000 / #ffffff
  text      --accent-pure-cta-fg  #ffffff / #000000
  radius    9999px (pill)
  padding   10px 24px
  height    32px (md) / 36px (lg) — no 40px size (DS-4 G1)
  type      text-13 / font-medium 500 (DS-4 G4)
  hover     --button-cta-hover    = --accent-hover  #262626 / #e5e5e5   (swap-color; was opacity-90 on the private prototype, DS-4 G2, intentional)
  pressed   --button-cta-pressed  cta hover mixed a further 10% toward --accent-pure-cta-fg
  disabled  opacity 60%; ordinary pointer
  note      pure black on white (inverts in Dark); at most one per screen
  impl      components/ui/button.tsx variant="cta"
```

**Why hover / pressed are derived, not aliased** (DS-4; ratios ruled by the designer 2026-09-04): in Dark, `--surface-hover` and `--surface-chip` resolve to the same value in default-dark / cindy-dark / one-dark-pro / monokai-pro, so aliasing primary's hover to `--surface-hover` made the hover state invisible; `--surface-hover-soft` sat within 2/255 of `--surface-elevated` in cindy-dark, breaking secondary the same way. Each state is therefore mixed off **its own variant's rest fill toward its own foreground** — 8% for hover, a further 10% for pressed. The ladder follows any theme override automatically and introduces no theme-blind literals. Guard: `themes/__tests__/buttonStateContrast.test.ts` asserts every builtin theme keeps each step at ΔRGB ≥ 8. These are runtime-derived values, registered but not modeled in the DTCG shadow layer (governance §3.4).

### Cards & Containers

```
card/container
  fill      --surface-elevated    #ffffff / #2c2c2a   (page-level flat layouts use --surface instead — §2 layer rule)
  border    1px solid --border-default   #d7d7d4 / #3c3c3a   (only when separation is needed)
  radius    12px (container tier; Tailwind rounded-xl literal)
            ⚠ do NOT use §10's --radius — that is shadcn's 0.5rem (8px) primitive, unrelated to this 12px container radius
  shadow    none
  hover     --surface-hover       #e5e5e5 / #3c3c3a
```

### Provider detail header

All provider connections share one header pattern, independent of builtin/custom storage or login source.
Model counts belong in the provider list, not the detail header. The fixed slots are: brand mark; connection display name and access type; account/source
subtitle; connection status, at most one primary action and one overflow menu. Editing and deletion
belong in that shared menu, not additional provider-specific icon buttons. Identity text is not an
implicit expand/collapse target. At narrow widths, wrap the action group without clipping controls.
Use existing Button, menu and themed settings styles; radii and hit targets follow §5, icon-only
controls follow §14.6, and both Light/Dark follow §10. Account usage sits below the header identity
row with the existing layer separation, not a nested card. Provider-specific authentication and
recovery content may fill the explanation slot without replacing the header layout.
Identity, state, action semantics and pending implementation are defined in
[供应商设置](../product-rules/provider-settings.md). This contract does not declare existing headers migrated.

### Inputs & Forms

```
input/text
  fill        --surface-elevated  #ffffff / #2c2c2a
  text        --text-primary      #262626 / #d4d4d4
  border      --border-default    #d7d7d4 / #3c3c3a
  radius      9999px (pill — single-line inputs)
  height      32px (sm) / 36px (md) / 40px (lg)  (DS-4 G1; three sizes, shared 4px step with buttons)
  focus       --focus-ring-soft   rgba(65,124,221,0.5)   (50% of #417CDD; opaque border variant = --focus-ring)
              DS-6: approved soft ring; settings retain their local focus-border alias; error styling takes priority. Light/Dark and legacy-theme readability must be verified.
  placeholder --text-placeholder  #c4c4c4 / #525252
  error       --error-border / --error-fg
  impl        components/ui/input.tsx
  disabled    60% opacity + ordinary pointer  (new in DS-4; the pre-DS-4 SettingsTextInput had no disabled styling and none of its 6 consumers passed it)
  ivory       surface="ivory" → --settings-input-bg (--surface-card-ivory). Explicit white-panel / nested-card surface (DS-6 decision); elevated remains the default. Preserve local theme overrides.
```

- **Multi-line inputs (textarea) take the 8px inner-control radius — never the pill** (tall frames deform it), whether nested in a container or standing alone in a form (§5 radius scale; single rule, no nesting condition). Implementation: `components/ui/input.tsx` `Textarea`.
- **Existing settings inputs retain their local theme contract** through `SettingsTextInput`, a thin wrapper over `ui/input`. It supplies the historical `settings-input-text`, `settings-input-border`, `settings-input-border-focus`, and `settings-input-placeholder` aliases via `inputClassName`. Their defaults still resolve to Tier-1; explicit local overrides stay local. Generic `Input` keeps the Tier-1 defaults above. Standard error-state border/ring takes precedence over wrapper styles. Do not promote these legacy overrides into global semantic slots or rewrite user theme files. Existing placeholder load-time normalization remains unchanged.
- Placeholders must **read as clearly empty** — Silver (`#a3a3a3`) is too prominent against either Card surface (≈5:1 Dark / ≈2.6:1 Light) and reads as real input; forbidden. **Every input surface's placeholder (chat / ask / settings / plan-action-fb) resolves to `--text-placeholder`** (2026-06 G3, archived in `design-decision-log.md`); non-default themes express their own placeholder color by overriding `text-placeholder`.

**DS-6 form usage (approved 2026-09-08)**: use `FormField` for a real field's label, hint and inline validation error; pass its render-function props to `Input` / `SettingsTextInput`. `required` supplies assistive semantics only, never adds browser validation or changes the business rules. Reserve feedback space on fields that can fail and focus/scroll to the first invalid field; dynamic rows keep stable IDs when siblings are added or removed. Service failures remain Toasts. No new Textarea consumer is required.

`Button loading` retains its accessible label and dimensions, exposes `aria-busy`, disables activation, and reuses `Spinner` (static under reduced motion). The form owns the request and a synchronous duplicate-submit guard: actual saving blocks Cancel/Esc/scrim; success closes through the original callback, failure restores editing. Independent connection tests/model fetching remain independent. No change to cancellation, settlement, configuration, secrets or payload contracts.

Ordinary confirmations opt into standard buttons with `presentation="standard"` on the shared `ConfirmDialog` / provider. DS-6 selects only custom-provider and custom-MCP deletion. Standard confirmation actions keep a 36px minimum height; long labels wrap within the panel and may grow vertically instead of overflowing or truncating. Keep `confirm-btn-*` local styling, default/destructive choice, focus branches and no scrim dismissal. Unselected callers, Permission, Full Access and plugin authorization keep their existing presentation.

### Select & Dropdown

- **Trigger**: same as a single-line input — pill (9999px), Card bg, 1px Board border, carrying the current value + a chevron.
- **Panel**: a container — 12px radius, Card bg (`--surface-elevated`), 1px Board border, no shadow (separation comes from the overlay / layer colors), 6–8px padding.
- **Panel width must bind to the trigger width** — never narrower or wider than the control that opened it. Radix Select: `position="popper"` + `width: var(--radix-select-trigger-width)`; other primitives measure the trigger. (A repeatedly-tripped rule: dropdown width must match the control above.)
- **Option rows**: selected / hovered highlight fills use the **8px inner radius** (see §5 — the panel is a 12px container, the row highlight is the inner 8px tier; the inner radius must be smaller than the container's to nest cleanly). Highlight bg via `--surface-hover` / Radix `data-[highlighted]`; selected rows get the chip fill, unselected rows stay transparent.
- **Composer dropdown rows (the model / permission / + MorphPopover menus) — one unified contract** (2026-07-22): every option row in these three menus must match **verbatim** — horizontal padding `px-3`, radius `rounded-[8px]`, and both hover and selected fills on the **same token `--model-item-hover`**; the selected state is additionally marked only by a check + `font-medium` (danger-tier orange / blue tints **text only**, never the fill). **Why not `--surface-chip` for the selected fill**: the cindy default skins tune `--surface-hover` / `--surface-chip` to sit-on-page values that are darker than the lifted panel (`--surface-elevated`), which would make row highlights invisible; so menu-row hover resolves to the component-level token `--model-item-hover`, overridden in cindy-dark / cindy-light to "one step above the panel" (dark lifts lighter, light presses darker). When touching any of these three menus' row styles, change all three in sync — never just one.

### Dialog & Modal

Reference implementation: `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/ui/confirm-dialog.tsx` (the shared confirm dialog); new dialogs reuse its structure — do not invent a parallel one.

- **Overlay**: the full-screen scrim uses the `--overlay-modal` token (ConfirmDialog's current `neutral-900/40` hardcoded pair is legacy — **new dialogs always use the token**; do not copy the legacy pair).
- **Tooltips opened inside the modal** (2026-09-08, DS-6 review fix): the shared `Tip` portals its content to `document.body` on the default `z-[60]` layer — **below** the `z-[10000]` modal overlay, so an unraised tooltip is covered by its own dialog. Any `Tip` whose trigger lives inside a modal must raise its content above the host dialog: pass `contentClassName="z-[10001]"` to `Tip`, and `secretTipContentClassName="z-[10001]"` on `Input` for the password reveal button (both DS-6 forms do). This mirrors the existing `z-[10001]` popover/dropdown convention inside `z-[10000]` dialogs.
- **Container**: a container — 12px radius (`rounded-xl`), `--confirm-bg`, `--confirm-shadow`, 16px padding (`p-4`), centered. Width: confirm/notice dialogs ≈ 400px (`max-w-[400px]`); dialogs with inputs/forms may widen to ≈ 460px and shrink with the viewport (`min(460px, 100vw-32px)`). The DS-6 multi-runtime provider and MCP forms use 600px with the same 16px viewport gutters and a scrollable body capped within 88vh.
- **Title / description**: `--confirm-title` / `--confirm-desc`, medium weight.
- **Buttons**: pill (9999px); primary = inverse neutral (`--confirm-btn-primary-*`, not an automatic CTA assignment), secondary/cancel = outlined (`--confirm-btn-secondary-*`, transparent fill + Board border); footer `justify-end`.
- **Focus on open**: dismissible forms focus their primary input. Ordinary AlertDialog confirmation retains Cancel by default; explicit `autoFocusConfirm` focuses the primary action, while a required typed confirmation takes precedence. Preserve primary → optional third → Cancel DOM order (DS-6 decision).
- **Closing affordance** (made explicit 2026-07-30, scope clarified 2026-07-31): **dismissible** dialogs (wizards, catalogs, forms — anything a user may abandon freely) close via the footer Cancel button, Esc, and a scrim click, and carry **no top-right × close icon** — a × coexisting with Cancel is a spec violation, not a convenience. Confirm-tier dialogs built on AlertDialog (ConfirmDialog) intentionally do **not** close on scrim click (a deliberate mis-tap guard) — that behavior stays. The provider form has no ×. Its existing image-generation interruption confirmation is a separate business layer and retains its current dismissal contract.
- **Multi-step dialogs / wizards** (registered 2026-07-30, first consumer: Add-Provider wizard): the step indicator lives in the header row (round numbered chips — current step solid `--accent-cta-bg` with `--surface-on-card` text, completed steps ✓ on `--surface-chip`, upcoming outlined `--border-default`). Footer: **back navigation ("← 上一步") is a left-aligned bare text button** (`--text-secondary`, 13px/500, no background — the §5 bare-text-button exemption, no radius) — navigation is not a commit action and must not sit inside the right-aligned pill group; commit actions (取消 / 下一步 / 完成) remain right-aligned pills per the button rule above. Catalog/list steps put the scrollable region between **two full-width 1px `--border-default` hairlines**, with permanent entries (e.g. 自定义端点) pinned below the scroll region, always visible. Width matches the custom-provider form dialog (600px, `min(600px, 100vw-32px)`) so the two provider dialogs read as one family; height is capped at `min(640px, 85vh)` — on large displays a catalog dialog must not stretch toward full-screen height (2026-07-30 ruling).

### Tabs

**Tab Pills**

- Pill-shaped tab selectors (e.g. the Claude | Codex agent switch on the new-session screen)
- Active: Light Gray bg (`--surface-chip`); Inactive: transparent
- All pill-shaped (9999px)

### Settings segmented controls

- Use `components/settings/SettingsSegmentedControl.tsx` for a compact, mutually exclusive setting on a settings card. This is a radio group, not navigation between tab panels.
- Use the original browser automation target treatment (user preference, 2026-09-07): a borderless pill track with `--surface-chip`, 32px height, 3px padding and 2px gap. Options: 28px height, 12px text with line-height 1, 12px horizontal padding and a reserved 1px border.
- Selected: `--surface-elevated`, `--settings-section-title`, weight 500, and a 1px `--border-default` outline. The outline and raised fill distinguish selection from the track; `--surface-chip` is only the track, never the selected fill.
- Unselected: transparent fill/border, `--text-secondary`, weight 400; enabled hover uses `--text-primary`. Disabled options retain the selected mark at 50% opacity and cannot change value or gain hover feedback. Keyboard focus uses `--focus-ring`.
- Use `radiogroup` / `radio` / `aria-checked`. Tab enters at the selected option (or first option when no preset matches); arrows move focus and selection, wrap at the ends, and respect RTL. Home/End select the first/last option. Space/Enter activate the focused option.

### Usage data graphics

- `UsageHeatmap` and `UsageTokenBars` encode dates and quantities, including when clicking a mark filters by date. **Clickable data marks keep their data geometry; they are not ordinary pill buttons.** Their corner treatment is the registered data-mark members `usage-heatmap-day` and `usage-token-bar` (§5) — **the registration covers the coloured mark itself, not its hit region, legend, container or tooltip** — and is limited to these usage charts. For the heatmap, the transparent date hit target overlays the cell and shares its 12×12 footprint. For the token bars, the hit target may extend beyond a low or zero bar — the implementation gives it at least 24px of height — while the bar itself keeps its data height. In both charts the hit target's corner treatment is an implementation choice (currently the mark's 2px) and is not fixed by the registration; focus and selection indicators are independent of the registration and follow §5's interaction rules.
- Heatmap: 12×12px square cells, 2px radius and 3px gaps in both read-only and clickable views. Reserve a 3px outer gutter so edge cells retain their focus/selected outlines. Preserve month alignment, the complete requested history window and the existing four-level neutral intensity scale.
- Token bars: 30 equal-width slim columns fitted to the plot, 3px gaps, 2px outer radius, shared baseline and proportional stacked segments. Do not enforce a 24px minimum column width or clip the latest days behind horizontal scrolling. A low/zero bar may have a taller transparent hit target without inflating its data height.
- Preserve native date/value tooltips, accessible date/value labels, keyboard activation and visible focus/selected outlines. Charts stay on the semantic gray palette except for the owner-approved Usage History chart colors registered in §2 (2026-09-08); this remains a geometry exception, not permission to introduce further category colors or apply chart radii to other buttons.

### Usage History Charts

The usage heatmap, daily-token bars and their separate interaction indicators follow [the Usage History component specification](./usage-history-charts.md). Their 2px data-mark geometry is set by the §5 registered data-mark members (`usage-heatmap-day` / `usage-token-bar`); the bounded hover/focus/selection emphasis is registered with those members in §5 (interaction constraints), and the extensible model palette, fixed Agent/harness colors and heatmap blue are the §2 Usage History color registration. Date filtering enters through the charts themselves (cell / bar hit targets) plus the range selector on the page — the formerly drafted single-day date form is not part of this entry, and the component spec records the unresolved target-size ruling separately.

### Desktop chat and operation authorization (DS-9, 2026-09-11)

Chat prose and compact code use the existing `chatChrome.ts` presentation entry; activity rows reuse `activityRowChrome.ts`. Keep user/assistant, tool, code, thinking and media theme aliases local. Icon actions use the ordinary pill frame with their contextual targets, visible keyboard focus and a Tip; a hidden message action bar becomes visible when keyboard focus enters it. Media previews and content-clipping cards retain their content geometry under §5. Do not change message identity, streaming, history, Diff Worker/virtualization or media/file lifecycles to share presentation.

**IM context card disclosures (owner-confirmed HTML direction, registered 2026-09-12, #4367):** `HookTaskCard` has two narrowly scoped bare-text controls: long-body expand/collapse and the attached-context disclosure. Both remain frameless in resting, hover and expanded states; group contents also have no background frame. This records the confirmed quiet presentation, not a general exemption for chat actions. Both controls share a minimum 24px hit height/width and 4px vertical padding, retain native button keyboard activation, and use a separate visible `focus-ring` outline. Text uses `text-tertiary`, with `text-secondary` on hover, in both modes; context text may wrap. The outer message card retains its existing content-clipping treatment. This registration does not assert real-client visual acceptance; Light/Dark HTML previews are not client screenshots.

**Desktop Permission decisions, user-approved 2026-09-11 after actual-component comparison:** Allow once remains the visual main action using `perm-allow-*`; deny and session-scoped allow remain secondary. Retain neutral operation information: Desktop has no trusted risk-level field, and `autoReviewUnavailable` is not a risk conclusion. No invented danger variant or command-based risk inference. Keep the request in the composer area with title → description → scrollable operation → right-aligned wrapping actions, at the existing density. Use Button with a narrow local-alias adaptation; apply §5's existing pill-button and keycap treatments. Keep long scoped rules bounded by the column and available in the Tip. Labels, order, shortcuts, IME/editable-focus guards, submitting and failure recovery remain owned by the existing permission flow. This decision does not cover permission mode selectors, account/plugin authorization lifecycles or Mobile layout; Mobile is deferred to its own phase.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System

- Base unit: 8px
- Scale: 4px, 6px, 8px, 10px, 12px, 14px, 16px, 20px, 24px, 32px, 40px, 48px
- Ordinary action-frame padding: 10px 24px per the §4 button entries. Registered keycaps, data marks and bare-text buttons follow their component treatments; a `<button>` tag alone does not assign this padding to a visible layer or hit region (§5 Border Radius Scale).
- Container padding: dialogs 16px (`p-4`, see §4 Dialog & Modal); dropdown panels 6–8px (see §4 Select & Dropdown)

### Layout Structure (App)

- Full-window three-region structure: sidebar + content area (+ optional right panel), separated by 1px Board dividers on a single flat Surface — never by background shifts (see §2 layer rule).
- Centered-card layouts (login, empty states) follow the Surface + Card two-layer rule in §2.
- Reading-width content (settings forms, document previews) is centered with a comfortable max width; full-bleed content (chat stream, file tree) fills its region.

### Whitespace Philosophy

- **Emptiness as luxury**: no surface overstays its welcome — each concept gets minimal but sufficient space.
- **Content density is low by design**: one clear idea per surface. When a screen needs more, split it into progressive disclosure (§14) instead of packing it tighter.
- **The white space IS the brand**: calm, undecorated space communicates "this tool gets out of your way."

### Border Radius Scale

*(rewritten 2026-09-07 — owner-authorized rule decision, see `design-decision-log.md` 09-07. Supersedes the 08-29 three-tier wording and folds in the 07-28 micro-cell exception and the 09-06 keycap ruling.)*

**What this section assigns a radius to is a *visible layer* — one specific frame, surface, or clipping outline — not a DOM tag and not a whole component.** A single control routinely carries several: a "运行 ⌘Enter" button has a pill action frame, a 4px keycap inside it, and a hit-testing responsibility that needs no frame of its own. Assign each layer on its own. **A parent's radius is not the assignment rule for a contained layer.** A container may retain its approved content-clipping treatment, but an interaction wrapper must not use its own geometry to replace a contained mark's registered geometry.

**Assignment is a two-step decision tree. Step 1 wins over Step 2.**

**This section is the authoritative source for radius assignment.** Component entries and the summaries in §§1, 4, 7 and 9 reference it; they do not introduce competing assignment rules. The decision log records decisions and history, not a second current-value table.

#### Step 1 — Registered shapes

**A layer uses a registered shape only when an approved entry below covers that specific visible layer and use.** The entry supplies its corner treatment. Semantic arguments support an application for registration; they do not establish membership. Adding or widening an entry requires adjudication under the design-governance process and a decision-log record. **Neither an author nor a reviewer may create membership merely by interpreting this section.**

| Category | Scope | Corner radius |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Keyboard keycap** | Every visible keyboard shortcut frame, whether rendered as `<kbd>` or as an interactive button that accepts the shortcut. Border, fill, padding and text colors stay appropriate to the surrounding surface; the radius is the shared cross-surface rule. *(Registered 2026-09-06, #4001.)* | 4px |
| **Data mark** | A visible layer inside a chart or visualization whose shape belongs to the data rather than to the control. Members below. *(Registered 2026-09-07.)* | 0px or 2px, pinned per member |

**Overlap.** A keyboard shortcut frame retains its registered 4px treatment when another channel, such as colour, also encodes data. Data encoding alone does not override the keycap entry. Other overlaps must be resolved explicitly in the registration; listing order alone does not grant precedence.

**Registered data-mark members.** The value is fixed per member, never chosen at the call site:

| Member ID | Covered visible layer | Corner radius |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `usage-heatmap-day` | The coloured cell representing one day's usage in `UsageHeatmap`. Excludes the hit region, legend, outer container and tooltip. | 2px, all four corners |
| `usage-token-bar` | The coloured bar representing one day's token volume in `UsageTokenBars`. Excludes the hit region, outer container and tooltip. Its own clipping may follow the same treatment. Top-only rounding or square baseline corners are not variants of this registration. | 2px, all four corners |
| `workflow-status-cell` | The coloured micro-cell in the agent status strip (background-tasks panel detail + workflow chat card). | 2px, all four corners |
| `system-category-square` | The registered per-category status square in SystemCard. | 2px, all four corners |

*A member ID identifies an approved visual role, not a filename or an entire component subtree. Reuse within its stated scope and semantics-preserving refactors do not require a new radius ruling; keep implementation references current. A new role, wider scope or changed geometry requires adjudication. Component entries reference the member ID and record other dimensions and interaction details instead of maintaining a second radius value.*

*The last two members absorb the narrow "status micro-cells (2px)" exception registered 2026-07-28. Their value and their components are unchanged; what changes is the basis — they are classified by the role their shape plays, not by being ≤8px and non-interactive. See the decision log for the two scope changes this entails. The first two members likewise carry the usage-chart geometry that #4064 phrased as a separate "usage data marks (2px)" exception; that parallel wording was folded into these registrations when this section merged, and §4 Usage data graphics is the component entry that records their dimensions.*

**Evidence required to register a new data mark** — what an adjudication request must establish. **Not** a self-service test that admits a layer automatically:

1. a stable mapping from a data field to a visual channel of that layer (position, size, area, colour intensity, **or categorical colour**);
2. which visible layers belong to the data and which belong to the control, stated separately;
3. that the classification does not depend on the current number of data points, the label text, the presence of a click handler, or the rendering technology (DOM / SVG / canvas).

Ordinary input options, control selected-states and action frames do **not** enter merely by carrying data. Mixed objects are resolved in the component entry.

#### Content and unresolved shapes

**Pixels and intrinsic geometry within images, icons and other assets are not control frames.** Existing approved content and cropping treatments follow their owning component specifications; any surrounding action frame is assigned separately. Replacing an asset within such a treatment does not register a new shape.

A new content-owned outline or mixed object not covered by an existing specification **must be submitted for adjudication**. Reviewers report unresolved classification and request the missing decision; they must **neither force the object into the pill tier solely because it is clickable nor approve an unregistered exception**.

#### Step 2 — Control tiers

Ordinary control frames, containers and inner-control surfaces not covered by Step 1 use the following three tiers.

- **Pill (9999px)** — control frames: buttons, tabs, single-line inputs, tags, badges. **A control's fill style never changes its tier** — transparent and outlined fills are still pills (dialog secondary/cancel are pills with a transparent fill).
- **Container (12px)** — the box that holds content: code blocks, cards, panels, dialogs. Tailwind `rounded-xl`.
- **Inner control (8px)** — multi-line inputs (textarea), **always 8px** whether nested in a visible container or standing alone in a form; plus selected/hover row highlights in dropdowns/menus, and small in-block cells nested inside a container. Tailwind `rounded-lg`.

**A layer with no frame or surface to round needs no corner-radius assignment.** This does not authorize a control to discard its prescribed frame treatment merely by omitting a fill or border. A transient hover or pressed surface on an ordinary control remains that control's frame and takes its assigned tier.

**A focus or selection indicator is a separate visual treatment.** Its appearance alone does not create a new ordinary control frame or reclassify the associated layer. Registered bare-text buttons (wizard back-navigation "← 上一步", the §16.3 login text-button category) remain frameless and retain their visible focus treatment; new bare-text-button usages must still be registered in the introducing component entry.

Evaluate the approved component treatment across its states, including shared styles and pseudo-elements. **The absence of a local background or border class is not evidence of frameless status.**

#### Interaction constraints — apply after assignment

Making something clickable never moves a layer between Step 1 and Step 2.

- **Hit testing and mark geometry are independent responsibilities; they may share a DOM element or drawing primitive. No additional wrapper is required.** Hit-target geometry must not replace, clip or distort the mark's registered visible geometry or its data mapping. The mark's own registered clipping remains permitted. Resetting an existing radius with `rounded-none` is permitted when needed to achieve this result; **the presence or absence of a particular class is not the compliance test**.
- **Focus and selection indicators use the associated component's approved interaction treatment.** For registered marks, the component entry identifies the indicator geometry; it must not be inferred by reclassifying the mark as a pill control. An indicator may be drawn on the existing element, a pseudo-element, an overlay or the drawing surface. It must remain distinguishable without changing the mark's registered geometry or data encoding.
- **On a data-bearing layer, hover must not alter the visual mapping that encodes the data.** Use a distinguishable indicator on a separate visual layer when the relevant channel is already occupied.
- **For the same data and display configuration, a registered mark's geometry and corner treatment must not change solely because interaction is enabled or disabled.** Independent hover, focus and selection indicators are allowed.
- **Hit-target sizing.** Registered data-mark status does not itself provide an exception from pointer-target requirements. For the usage heatmap and daily-token chart, dense date targets may be retained through the **Equivalent** route of WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8 only when the Usage History view also provides a date-selection control that satisfies that criterion and reaches every selectable date with the same filtering result. Relative presets alone are not equivalent to arbitrary single-day selection. **This control was ruled to ship in the same change as the dense restoration; that sequencing was overtaken when #4064 restored the dense targets first.** Until the control ships, the usage charts' dense targets are a registered, non-compliant transition — the Equivalent route is not yet available to them, the control is tracked as owed in the design inventory, and this transition is not precedent for reducing any other target. Overlapping targets for different dates are not an acceptable enlargement technique. These members have no category-wide Essential exemption. Keyboard access and visible focus remain required independently.
- **Registered interaction emphasis — Usage History charts (owner-approved 2026-09-08).** For the two registered data-mark members `usage-heatmap-day` and `usage-token-bar`, the component's approved interaction treatment additionally includes a bounded emphasis: the non-hit-testing visible layer may expand by 2px (heatmap cell width/height, bar width), which fits inside the 3px grid gaps and changes neither the grid pitch, the resting geometry, nor any data encoding; bar height, baseline, categorical colour tokens, heatmap intensity and hit regions do not change. The 09-08 reference refinement permits only the token chart to fade non-selected bars while an in-window date is selected or the recent-seven-day range is highlighted; the heatmap uses its registered neutral selection outline, bars stay without a pointer-selection outline, and keyboard focus stays independently visible. All four corner radii remain 2px throughout. The exact geometry and curve are specified in the component entry ([usage-history-charts.md](./usage-history-charts.md)); §14.4 carries the matching motion registration. No other member may borrow this emphasis.

#### Scope and inventory

*Do not invent radii. **"It looks small" is never a reason to move a layer down a tier** — within Step 2 a layer's tier follows what it IS (control frame / box / textarea), not its size or nesting. **This sentence governs Step 2 only**; it is not an argument that every clickable layer is a control. Mind nesting: an 8px row highlight inside a 12px panel must stay smaller than its container; a pill there becomes a lozenge, 12px looks bloated.*

*New tiers and new registered shapes both enter only through adjudication — neither is added by a reviewer's reading of this section.*

*Governed corner-radius values are **0px and 2px** for registered data marks, **4px** for keycaps, **8px** for inner controls, **12px** for containers, and **9999px** for pill frames. No 3px / 6px / 10px, and no arbitrary values. A layer with no frame to round needs no assignment; "no assignment" is not an additional radius value. **Intrinsic content and mark geometry remain outside this corner-radius inventory** — a scatter dot's circle, a pie sector's arc, a map outline are shapes of the mark itself. Existing non-keycap `rounded-[4px]` usages remain registered debt; bare `rounded` and `rounded-sm` substitute for nothing.*


## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level              | Treatment                                                                 | Use                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Flat (Level 0)     | No shadow, no border                                                      | Surface background, most content               |
| Bordered (Level 1) | `1px solid` Board (`#d7d7d4` Light / `#3c3c3a` Dark)                      | Cards, code blocks, dividers, section outlines |
| Lifted (Card)      | Card fill (`#ffffff` Light / `#2c2c2a` Dark) + optional 1px Board outline | Login cards, modals, raised panels             |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Cindy's base visual language uses **zero shadows**. This is not an oversight — it's a deliberate design decision. The flat, shadowless approach creates a paper-like experience where elements are distinguished purely by background color and single-pixel borders. Depth is communicated through **content hierarchy and typography weight**, not visual layering. (The only shadows in the system are the token-gated floating-layer exceptions registered in §10 — `--shadow-menu` / `--cmd-palette-shadow` / `--confirm-shadow`; never add ad-hoc shadows to in-page elements. A Switch-knob shadow was trialed and explicitly rejected — user ruling 2026-08-05: the legacy `shadow-lg` on the 16px thumb was invisible in practice, and a visible replacement read as noise; the knob is flat by decision, don't re-add it.)

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Use Surface (`#f8f8f6` Light / `#1f1f1e` Dark) as the page background — every page starts here
- Assign each visible layer using §5: check Step 1 registered shapes (keyboard keycaps and data-mark members) first; ordinary control frames then take the Step 2 pill tier.
- Use the §5 Step 2 container tier for content boxes — code blocks, cards, panels; assign contained layers separately.
- Use the §5 Step 2 inner-control tier for multi-line inputs (textarea, always), dropdown/menu row highlights and in-block cells not covered by Step 1.
- Keep the palette strictly grayscale — chromatic color only via the sanctioned semantic set in §2, always through tokens
- Use Inter at weight 400 / 500 for display headings (per the §3 Hierarchy rows) — hierarchy comes from size + weight, not typeface switching
- Maintain zero shadows — depth comes from borders and background shifts only
- Keep content density low — each section should present one clear idea
- Use monospace for terminal commands and code — it's primary content, not decoration
- Keep ordinary action frames on their §4 component treatment and §5 assigned tier, including transient hover / pressed surfaces. Focus and selection indicators are separate treatments: their appearance alone creates no ordinary control frame and does not reclassify the associated layer. Registered bare-text buttons remain frameless with visible focus; evaluate approved states, shared styles and pseudo-elements, not only local background or border classes.

### Don't

- Don't introduce any chromatic color outside the sanctioned semantic set in §2 — no brand blue, no accent green, no warm tones beyond the registered exceptions
- Don't invent arbitrary radii — §5 governs the inventory: 0px / 2px for registered data marks (pinned per member), 4px for keycaps, 8px for inner controls, 12px for containers and 9999px for pill frames. No 3px / 6px / 10px or arbitrary values. Frameless layers need no assignment; intrinsic content and mark geometry remain outside this corner-radius inventory. Existing non-keycap `rounded-[4px]` usages remain registered debt; bare `rounded` and `rounded-sm` substitute for nothing.
- Don't add shadows to any element — the flat aesthetic is intentional
- Don't use font weights above 600 in UI chrome — 700 only inside the exemption domains registered in the §3 registry (that table is the single source of truth; it currently covers markdown content, hljs theme ports, login / Splash brand canvas, third-party viewers under `vendor/`, and imperative third-party APIs). Don't re-enumerate the domains here — read §3. No 800+, no in-between values, anywhere
- Don't add decorative illustrations — Cindy's working UI carries no mascots or artwork; brand imagery appears only on the explicitly enumerated sanctioned brand surfaces in §15.7 / §16
- Don't use gradients anywhere — flat blocks and borders only
- Don't overcomplicate the layout — stick to the region structure in §5; no complex nested grids
- Don't use borders heavier than 1px — containment is always the lightest possible touch
- Don't add decorative or large-motion animation — no bounce, parallax, looping, or gratuitous movement. Short **functional** state transitions (color / background / opacity, ≤150ms) are fine and expected — see §14.4.

## 8. Window & Adaptive Behavior

Cindy Desktop is an Electron app: layout responds to window resizing, not page breakpoints.

### Desktop Window

- Minimum window size: **800 × 600** for the main window and secondary session windows (enforced at the BrowserWindow level — `apps/desktop/src/main/bootstrap-electron.ts` / `secondary-windows.ts`). The detached right-sidebar window has its own smaller floor of **360 × 480** (`right-sidebar-window/window.ts`) — layouts hosted there must stay legible down to that width
- The sidebar is collapsible; region dividers and paddings hold as the window narrows, and content reflows fluidly
- Chat stream and composer reflow with the window; code blocks keep horizontal scroll instead of wrapping
- Ordinary control sizes and paddings follow their §4 component treatments at every window size. Registered shapes and their hit regions follow their owning component treatments and §5 Interaction constraints; the usage charts' dense date targets use the Equivalent route only under the conditions stated there. Window resizing does not waive the applicable target requirements or authorize changing a mark's registered geometry.

### Mobile

Cindy Mobile (React Native) has its own device-class rules (phone / pad portrait / pad landscape). The surfaces specified so far are documented in §15.13 (cross-platform skin rules) and §16 (login); mobile layout beyond those surfaces follows `apps/mobile` as implemented.

### Quick Color Reference

- Primary Text: "Pure Black (#000000)" Light / "Soft Gray (#d4d4d4)" Dark
- **Surface** (page bg): "Light Surface (#f8f8f6)" / "Dark Surface (#1f1f1e)"
- **Card** (elevated layer): "Pure White (#ffffff)" / "Dark Card (#2c2c2a)"
- **Board** (1px dividers/borders): "Light Board (#d7d7d4)" / "Dark Board (#3c3c3a)"
- Secondary Text: "Stone (#737373)" Light / "Silver (#a3a3a3)" Dark — `--text-secondary`
- Tertiary Text: "Silver (#a3a3a3)" Light / "Stone (#737373)" Dark — `--text-tertiary`
- Near Black: (#262626) — Light primary reading text
- Chip/Button Background: "Light Gray (#e5e5e5)" Light / "Dark Chip (#3c3c3a)" Dark — `--surface-chip` (the collapse-to-Card variant `--surface-chip-alt` #2c2c2a: see §2)

### Example Component Prompts

- "Create a settings section: an ivory Card (--surface-card-ivory, 12px radius, 1px --border-default outline) on the Surface page background; section title 14px Inter 500, body rows 14px 400."
- "Design a code block with a 12px border-radius, 1px solid Board (#d7d7d4 Light / #3c3c3a Dark) border on Card background. Use JetBrains Mono for the code. No shadow."
- "Build a tab bar with pill-shaped tabs (9999px radius). Active tab: Light Gray (#e5e5e5) background, Near Black (#262626) text. Inactive: transparent background, Stone (#737373) text."
- "Build a chat composer: a Card-colored (--surface-elevated) 12px-radius container; inside, pill control chips (9999px) that are borderless at rest and gain a --border-default outline on hover."
- "Design a confirm dialog: 12px-radius container, max-width 400px, pill buttons — inverse neutral primary, optional outlined third action, then outlined Cancel; Cancel receives initial focus unless the caller explicitly selects primary focus or requires typed confirmation."
- "Create a dropdown: pill trigger; panel width bound to the trigger; 12px-radius Card panel with 1px Board border; option rows highlighted with 8px inner radius via --model-item-hover."

### Iteration Guide

1. Focus on ONE component at a time
2. Keep all values grayscale — "Stone (#737373)" not "use a light color"
3. Assign the specific visible layer through §5: check Step 1 registered shapes first (keycaps or an approved data-mark member), then use Step 2 for ordinary control frames, containers and inner-control surfaces. Keep contained content, hit testing and focus / selection indicators separate as §5 requires; submit unresolved shapes for adjudication.
4. Shadows are always zero — never add them
5. Weight is 400/500 for everyday chrome, 600 for rationed emphasis — 700 never appears in new UI (registered exemption domains in §3 only)
6. If something feels too decorated, remove it — less is always more

## 10. Theme System & Token Reference

### Light / Dark Dual-Mode Delivery Gate(双模式交付门槛)

- **Every UI must be implemented for both Light and Dark modes.** When adding or changing any page, component, layout, style, motion, or UI copy, both modes must be designed and built within the same piece of work; designing or implementing only one mode counts as incomplete. **Visual QA in both modes is expected effort, not a blocking gate** — see the last bullet.
- Both modes must cover every state actually touched by the change — default, hover, pressed, selected, focus, disabled, loading, empty, error, overlays and scrims. States the change does not touch need not be retrofitted just to tick a box.
- Colors must be consumed through semantic tokens; hardcoded values or conditional patches that only fit one mode are forbidden. When the design mock provides only one mode, the other mode must still be filled in through the existing token system; if a clear semantic mapping is missing, request a design ruling first — never ship with a mode omitted.
- **Verification is best-effort and must be reported honestly.** Eyeballing the affected surfaces in both Light and Dark before delivery is the preferred path, but skipping it does not block the change — say plainly in the commit / PR verification notes which mode was actually checked and which was not. Never upgrade "reused existing themed styles / added no raw color values" into a claim that both modes were verified. If a mode _is_ checked and comes back unreadable, indistinguishable, missing states, or visibly regressed, that is a real defect and must be fixed before delivery.

### Architecture

Cindy Desktop manages color with a **VSCode-style ColorRegistry + theme-override** model. Every color reaches components as a CSS-variable token; **hardcoding hex / rgba inside a component is never allowed** (it makes the component un-themeable outside the default theme).

Source: `apps/desktop/src/renderer/themes/`

- `color-registry.ts` — the `ColorRegistry` singleton and the `registerColor(id, defaults, description)` API
- `colors.ts` — registers every token, organized "semantic slots first, aliases and singletons after" (counts drift constantly — **the registration API in `colors.ts` is the live inventory; generated defaults are edited in `packages/design-tokens/src`**; this document does not track totals)
- `theme-service.ts` — `applyTheme(theme)` serializes all tokens into `:root{}` and injects `<style id="theme-vars">`
- `builtin/` — built-in theme objects (`cindy-light.ts` / `cindy-dark.ts` / `eclipse.ts` / `default-light.ts` / `default-dark.ts` and the community palettes)
- `registry.ts` — the `builtinThemes` registry + `listThemesByType('light' | 'dark')`

Theme switching: `useTheme.ts` provides `theme` (System / Light / Dark mode) plus `lightThemeId` / `darkThemeId` (which concrete theme). Settings → Appearance is the UI entry.

### Token Tiers

**Tier 1 — Semantic slots**: the core cross-context slots; when adding a theme, this tier is the main override battleground. The exact-value summary below is generated from the Desktop DTCG source. Registry IDs and usages remain the compatibility contract.

<!-- END GENERATED DS-8: semantic-colors -->

**Tier 2 — Aliases**: the many component-scoped tokens (`--cmd-palette-bg`, `--msg-tool-card-text`, `--settings-input-border`, …) whose defaults resolve to `var(--slot)`. The browser forward-resolves automatically; components are unaware — **keep consuming the alias names directly**.

**Tier 3 — Singletons**: genuinely independent values that cannot collapse into a slot: semantic exemption colors (`--destructive` / `--diff-add-*` / `--status-bar-accent` …), platform-specific colors, splash durations, and non-color tokens such as `--radius`.

Mobile's `betaChannelBadgeBackground/Foreground` remain the cross-theme fixed pair `#DF0C27` /
`#FFFFFF`. They are limited to the enabled Beta-channel badge beside the installed app version
in mobile Settings, explicitly requested 2026-08-25. The Desktop sidebar uses ordinary text after
the version number and does not consume a red Beta badge token. This is a persistent channel-state
cue, not an error or CTA; the mobile white text contrast is 4.98:1.

Never freestyle these semantic colors as hardcoded hex — always go through the corresponding token.

### Built-in Themes

The implementation truth is `builtinThemes` in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/themes/registry.ts`; adding or removing themes does not require updating this document. The default light/dark (base) themes are exactly the §2 palette.

### Adding a New Theme (full flow)

1. Create `apps/desktop/src/renderer/themes/builtin/<id>.ts` exporting a `Theme` object:
   ```ts
   export const myTheme: Theme = {
     id: "my-theme",
     name: "My Theme",
     type: "light" | "dark",
     colors: {
       // Override only the tokens that differ from the base theme;
       // an empty object {} is also valid (identical to base).
       surface: "#xxx",
       "text-primary": "#xxx",
       // ... most themes only need to override 30–90 tokens
     },
   };
   ```
2. Register it in `builtinThemes` in `themes/registry.ts`
3. The Light/Dark Theme dropdowns in Settings → Appearance pick it up automatically

Use any existing non-default theme under `apps/desktop/src/renderer/themes/builtin/` as a template.

### Token Naming Conventions

- **slot**: `{category}-{subkind}[-{variant}]`, e.g. `text-primary-emphasis` / `surface-chip-alt`. The `-hsl` suffix marks the HSL-triplet form.
- **alias**: keeps its historical component-scoped name (`--cmd-palette-bg` / `--settings-back-text` …), no prefix.
- **singleton**: any clear semantic name, usually component-prefixed.

CSS variable names are always kebab-case. Dot-style ids (VSCode's `sidebar.itemActive`) are not used — CSS variables don't support them.

### Token Selection Rules for New UI

1. **grep `colors.ts` first**: your UI type usually maps to an existing slot/alias (card bg = `--cmd-palette-bg` / `--surface-elevated`, …)
2. **Slots first**: prefer a slot over a component-scoped alias (slots behave more predictably across themes)
3. **HSL tokens must be wrapped**: `hsl(var(--background))`, never bare `var(--background)` (the latter yields a raw HSL string, not a valid CSS color)
4. **No suitable token? Don't force one**: discuss adding a slot/singleton with the user instead
5. **Never** use `bg-[#xxx] dark:bg-[#xxx]` hardcoded pairs — the pre-P2 anti-pattern; it was migrated away once and new code must not reintroduce it

This section is the authoritative token-usage text; i18n rules for UI copy live in `docs/dev-rules/engineering-conventions.md` §5.

### External Theme Import (VSCode / Obsidian)

Settings → Appearance can import a VSCode color theme (`*.json` / jsonc) or an Obsidian `theme.css` and convert it into a local theme. Implementation: `apps/desktop/src/shared/theme-import/` (pure conversion) + `apps/desktop/src/main/local-themes/importer.ts` (dialog / read / write). Rules that govern it:

- **One template, taken from the hand-ported community themes.** The seven ported themes under `apps/desktop/src/renderer/themes/builtin/` (one-dark-pro, github-dark, eclipse, material-ocean-hc, monokai-pro, atom-one-light, solarized-light) share a byte-identical key set of 108 tokens derived from 13 palette roles plus the optional light-only `inputBg` role (CREATE AGENT card/input background, e.g. Solarized base2; absent ⇒ collapses to `surface`). Within the template, when a light palette supplies an `inputBg` distinct from `surface` (e.g. Solarized base2 cards), CREATE AGENT `*-hover` and the resting `quick-card-icon-bg` lift to `surface` (icon drops back to `chip` on hover); otherwise `*-hover`=`hover` and `quick-card-icon-bg` is `border` in dark / `chip` in light — keeping default/hover/icon visually distinct in every theme. `control-bg-pressed` is `chip` in dark and `hover` in light. `send-btn-bg`/`send-btn-icon` use the inverse-neutral pair (`textPrimary`/`surface`), not the accent, because the shared send tokens also render 10–12px text that must clear 4.5:1. `apps/desktop/src/shared/theme-import/palette.ts` is that derivation, code-ified; `one-dark-pro.ts`'s header comment is the source-of-truth for which VSCode key feeds which role. The template is **allow-list only** — it emits those 108 base ids plus the imported-theme-only `switch-track-off` / `switch-thumb-off` safety pair. Because external muted/comment colors are unconstrained, the track keeps the source `textSecondary` only when it clears the 3.2:1 derivation target (above the 3:1 non-text floor) against the relevant surfaces and thumb; otherwise the converter takes the smaller passing correction along the source-to-black/source-to-white paths, or rejects the palette with the dedicated contrast error rather than reporting it as an unrecognized file or internal error. Existing local snapshots created before this pair existed are backfilled with the same 3.2:1 target at renderer load time only when both tokens are absent and the complete legacy semantic palette is parseable; if no track can satisfy the target, the runtime restores the pre-upgrade `border-default` track and `surface` thumb instead of falling through to unchecked aliases. Disk JSON and explicit user overrides are never changed. Optional Markdown tokens (`md-h1-fg`…`md-h6-fg` / `md-strong-fg`) are added when the source theme provides heading or bold colors.
- **Exemption families are never imported.** `--login-*`, brand red, `--destructive`, `--error-*`, `--warning-accent`, `--status-bar-accent`, `--focus-ring*`, `--diff-*`, shadows and overlays stay at their spec values under every imported theme (see the exemption table above and §16). `apps/desktop/src/shared/theme-import/protected-tokens.ts` enforces it as a second gate; the import report tells the user how many tokens were held back.
- **`-hsl` tokens are computed, not copied.** Both forms of a color must denote the same color, so the converter derives every HSL triplet from its hex via `toHslTriplet()`. (Note: a few hand-written builtin themes carry approximate HSL values — `github-dark`'s `SURFACE_BG_HSL` was copied off one-dark-pro. Those are left as-is; new imports are exact.)
- **Markdown text colors go through `--md-h1-fg`…`--md-h6-fg` / `--md-strong-fg`, and default to `inherit`.** Before these tokens existed, Markdown headings and bold text inherited their color from the container (`baseComponents` sets size/weight only). Defaulting to `var(--text-primary)` would have repainted headings inside blockquotes, tool cards and secondary-text regions, so the defaults are `inherit` — every built-in theme renders exactly as before. Imported themes fill them from Obsidian `--hN-color` / `--bold-color` or VSCode `markup.heading` / `markup.bold`. Guard: `themes/__tests__/markdownColorTokens.test.ts`.
- **Obsidian import is a palette import, not a theme port.** Only CSS custom properties are read; selectors, layout, radii and fonts are discarded — Cindy's layout and typography stay owned by §3/§5. Values that cannot be evaluated statically (`color-mix()`, undefined `var()`) are skipped and reported rather than guessed.
- **Checked Switch track = theme accent (ported theme files only, user ruling 2026-08-05).** The seven ported theme files each override `switch-track-on` to their own accent (solarized-light uses `GREEN_DEEP` — the official `#859900` fails the 3:1 floor). The registry default stays `hsl(var(--primary))`: Classic and imported themes keep the pre-existing neutral checked track, and CINDY carries its own frozen decision-table values (Dark keeps `#EEEEEE`; Light deliberately lightened to `#4A4D51`). Guard: `switchThemeContrast.test.ts` asserts every builtin theme's checked track ≥3:1 against the checked thumb (`background`) and all five surfaces.
- **Local themes may declare an optional `family`.** Same-family light + dark variants merge into one switchable family (`themes/families.ts`); files without the field keep behaving exactly as before (family id = theme id). Obsidian's dual-mode CSS uses this to land as a single theme that follows Light/Dark mode.

## 11. Voice & Content(微文案规范)

> **Status: draft**, introduced 2026-06 (after the Voice & Content section of Vercel Geist's `design.md`). This section governs **how interface copy is written** and pairs with `docs/dev-rules/engineering-conventions.md` §5 (the i18n system) — that side enforces "copy lands via i18n keys, aligned across 5 languages"; this side governs each string's tone and wording. It adds no UI strings, only constraints.

Cindy's product voice matches its visuals: **restrained, direct, never self-congratulatory**. Copy is part of the tool, not marketing.

### 11.1 Language-Independent Principles (zh-CN / zh-TW / en / ja / ko alike)

- **Actions = verb + object, never a bare verb.** Buttons and menu items say what is done to what: `Deploy Project` / `删除会话` / `セッションを削除`. **Forbidden**: objectless verbs like `Confirm` / `OK` / `确定` / `提交` (confirm-dialog primary buttons especially must carry the object so they read correctly out of context).
- **Errors = what happened + what to do.** A bare "Failed / 出错了" is not acceptable — give the next step ("Connection timed out — check your network and retry"). Pairs with `docs/dev-rules/engineering-conventions.md` §2 (IPC error protocol): error codes are for code; the user-facing sentence must be human and actionable.
- **In-progress = present continuous + ellipsis.** `Deploying…` / `正在部署…` / `デプロイ中…`. The ChatView Thinking status bar (`Spelunking…`, Thinking Orange) already is this pattern; new loading/processing states follow it.
- **Results name the object — never say "success".** Toasts say what changed, not that an operation succeeded: `会话已删除` not `删除成功`; `Project deleted` not `Deleted successfully`. **Forbidden**: filler like "successfully / 成功了". (Toast visuals are §2; this rule is copy only.)
- **Empty states point at the first action** — never just "No data"; tell the user what they can do now ("No sessions yet — hit + to create one").
- **Neither servile nor cold — per language**: English never writes "Please" (the interface isn't begging). **Chinese 「请」 is idiomatic politeness and is exempt** — keep "请输入…" "请先授权" "请选择文件"; don't stiffen Chinese to satisfy the English rule. Neither language uses marketing adjectives ("强大的 / 极致 / 全新").

### 11.2 Casing & Punctuation Per Language (not transferable)

- **English**: labels / buttons / titles / tabs use **Title Case** (`Deploy Project`); body / help text / toasts use **sentence case**. Curly quotes and the ellipsis character `…`, never straight quotes or `...`.
- **zh-CN**: **no Title Case concept** — no per-word capitalization, no English-style punctuation in Chinese; keep English terms as-is in mixed text (`部署 Project`). No full stop at the end of toasts / labels.
- **zh-TW**: likewise has no Title Case; use Traditional Chinese characters and punctuation, while keeping English terms as-is in mixed text. No full stop at the end of toasts / labels.
- **ja / ko**: likewise no Title Case; follow each language's particle / politeness conventions, and verify terminology when unsure (per `docs/dev-rules/engineering-conventions.md` §5: no improvised ja/ko).
- **Numbers / units**: Arabic numerals + half-width in all five languages; number-to-unit spacing per language convention.

### 11.3 Self-Check (when touching copy)

- [ ] Action buttons carry an object — not a bare `确定` / `OK`
- [ ] Error copy says what to do next, not just that it failed
- [ ] No "successfully / 成功" filler
- [ ] In-progress states read "present continuous + …"
- [ ] All 5 `common.json` files updated, each matching its language's casing/punctuation (see `docs/dev-rules/engineering-conventions.md` §5)

## 12. Component Spec (merged into §4)

> The structured component-spec pilot (Buttons / Inputs / Cards) was adopted in 2026-07 and folded into §4 in place. This section number is kept as a placeholder: section numbers in this document are stable identifiers referenced by other documents, code comments, and frozen tests — do not renumber (see `design-decision-log.md`).

## 13. Open Spec / Token Gaps

No gaps are currently open.

Resolved items (G1–G4, 2026-06 — button-text drift, border drift, placeholder unification, radius tiering) are archived in [`design-decision-log.md`](./design-decision-log.md); each entry records the drift, the ruling, and where the conclusion was folded back (§2 / §4 / §5 / §10).

Known but deliberately-deferred cleanups are tracked in the decision log's backlog section, not here.

## 14. Interaction Conventions(交互约定)

> Introduced 2026-06. This spec used to govern only how things look (color / radius / type / spacing), not how they behave — whether text is selectable, where focus lands when a dialog opens, whether Enter sends or breaks the line; these kept needing case-by-case human correction. This section pins those **non-visual interaction behaviors** as global conventions, complementing §11 (copy tone). Whatever code can guarantee uniformly should not rely on human memory (per "code-first determinism" in `docs/dev-rules/maker-core-and-agent-behavior.md`).

### 14.1 Text Selectability (user-select)

- **Content is selectable**: message body text, code blocks, document previews — anything the user reads sentence-by-sentence or may want to copy. Selectable by default; leave it alone.
- **Selections survive focus changes**: moving focus into an embedded webview (plugin panel, built-in browser, etc.) must not clear the host selection or let Chromium repaint it as an unreadable inactive color. Global and editor selections use `--text-selection-bg`, which remains visible in both Light and Dark modes.
- **Chrome is not selectable**: buttons, menu items, labels/chips, status bars, badges, toolbars, sidebar rows — interface-skeleton text gets `select-none`. They are controls, not content; being selectable only gets in the way (typical offender: the goal-status chip label).
- Litmus test: would the user ever think "let me copy this"? Yes → selectable; no (it's just a control) → `select-none`.

### 14.2 Focus Management

- When a dialog / drawer / popover opens, focus lands on the **primary input** (or the primary button if there is no input) — **never** defaults to "Cancel". Radix focuses the first focusable element / Cancel by default — override with `onOpenAutoFocus` (`preventDefault()` + manual `focus()`) or ConfirmDialog's `autoFocusConfirm`.
- On close, focus returns to the triggering element (Radix default — don't break it).

### 14.3 Keyboard & IME (send-type text fields)

Applies to submit-on-Enter fields: the chat composer, goal input, ask input, etc. **Not** ordinary single-line editors in Settings — there Enter must not submit.

- **Enter = submit**, **Shift+Enter = newline**.
- **Enter during IME composition must not submit** — check `event.nativeEvent.isComposing` (a CJK user confirming a candidate must not accidentally send).
- Centralize this logic in code; do not re-implement it per field and let behavior drift (per "code-first determinism" in `docs/dev-rules/maker-core-and-agent-behavior.md`).

### 14.4 Motion & Transitions

> Expanded 2026-07. Cindy's motion character extends the paper-like restraint of §1 / §7: **ordinary UI fades, nudges, and resizes smoothly; overshoot is limited to the explicitly registered Done and Usage History chart responses below**. Functional state transitions are allowed; decorative motion is forbidden. This section pins "functional" into executable tiers and prototypes so components stop inventing their own durations and curves.

#### Motion tokens (the only tier source)

Global tokens live in `:root` of `apps/desktop/src/renderer/styles/globals.css`; mobile (`apps/mobile`) mirrors same-name same-value constants in `src/theme/tokens.ts` (dual-platform isomorphism, same policy as color tokens, landing with the mobile motion overhaul). **New transitions/animations must reference tokens — no hardcoded durations or cubic-beziers**; 5 interaction-duration tiers + 3 curves, the same philosophy as the §5 radius scale. Values outside the tiers require design review first. Narrow semantic exceptions are recorded directly below.

| Token                | Value                           | Use                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--motion-instant`   | 80ms                            | Instant hover feedback; light-overlay exit                                         |
| `--motion-fast`      | 150ms                           | Color/opacity state changes (`transition-colors` = this tier); light-overlay enter |
| `--motion-base`      | 200ms                           | Size changes: expand/collapse, panel open/close                                    |
| `--motion-enter`     | 250ms                           | Heavy-overlay (dialog) enter                                                       |
| `--motion-exit`      | 150ms                           | Heavy-overlay (dialog) exit                                                        |
| `--motion-ease-out`  | `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` | Enter / expand                                                                     |
| `--motion-ease-in`   | `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1)`    | Exit                                                                               |
| `--motion-ease-move` | `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`  | Position/size interpolation                                                        |

**Semantic loop-cycle exception:** `--motion-spinner-cycle` = `1000ms` is the
full-turn duration for functional loading spinners. It is not a sixth interaction
tier and must not be used for enter/exit, hover, resize, or decorative motion.
Spinner rotation remains linear, transform-only, mounted on an HTML wrapper, and
must become static under reduced motion. This exception keeps loading rotation
readable without coupling it to dialog timing or copying a hardcoded Tailwind
default into components.

**Sidebar title reading exception:** `--motion-sidebar-title-marquee-per-viewport`
= `2400ms` is the reading time for each visible-width span of an overflowing
Desktop sidebar task title. It is not an interaction-duration tier and is confined
to `SidebarTitleMarquee` in `SessionItem.tsx`: actual-overflow only, pointer hover
only, one-shot, reset immediately on pointer leave, and proportional to the number
of viewport spans needed to reveal the full title. The track may animate only
`transform` / `opacity`; `prefers-reduced-motion` keeps the original static
ellipsis (with the native full-title tooltip) and disables the track. This narrow
exception preserves readable, constant-paced title playback without allowing the
long duration to leak into any other hover or transition.

#### Semantics → motion prototypes (one semantic, one motion, app-wide)

| Semantic                                    | Spec                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Reference implementation                        |

Out: `animate-float-out` (opacity only, instant/ease-in). **Exit is always faster than enter, and never scales** (a scaling exit reads as "sucked away" — paper fades in place) | `components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx`               |

_Reference-implementation paths in this table are relative to `apps/desktop/src/renderer/`._

#### Red lines (performance & restraint)

- **Persistent/looping animation may only touch `transform` / `opacity` on HTML elements** (compositor-only; `docs/dev-rules/engineering-conventions.md` §7 applies in full; nothing animates on SVG).
- Non-compositor properties (height/grid …) are allowed only in **one-shot transient animations** (user-triggered, with a definite end) — never persistent.
- Every new `@keyframes` / `animate-*` class must be registered in the `prefers-reduced-motion` whitelist in `globals.css` (the global `* { transition: none }` does not catch keyframes).
- Real-time direct-manipulation interactions (resizer drag, drag-follow) get **no easing** — following the hand IS the feedback.
- Forbidden: pointless displacement, unregistered bouncing, parallax, looping decoration, `transition-all`, and typewriter per-character animation on streamed text (streaming already is the motion). Interactions stay fast and direct. (Per-**word** opacity fade-in on streamed text is **not** the typewriter — see the sanctioned stream-word-fade class below: the word is fully laid out and only its opacity ramps; ruled distinct on 2026-08-07.)
- **Cadenced running shimmer (2026-08-07)**: the running status bar's breathing (`status-bar-shimmer`) is **event-driven, not an infinite loop** — one 1.5s dip (1 → 0.45 → 1, `steps(18)`) plays per real sign of progress (status text change / token count advance; re-triggered via keyed remount in `RunningStatusBar`, back-to-back plays merge through an animation-end pending flag). Silence (long thinking, tool wait) holds steady full opacity. Semantics: _breathing = producing_, not _heartbeat = alive_. New loading/working indicators should prefer this cadenced pattern over a new infinite loop.

#### Registered response: Usage History chart emphasis (2026-09-08)

Only the two registered chart members inside Usage History may enlarge their non-hit-testing visible layer on hover, keyboard focus or selection. Enter uses `--motion-base` and the component-scoped `--usage-mark-ease`; leave uses `--motion-fast` / `--motion-ease-out`. The local curve has one small overshoot; no looping, replay on unrelated rerenders, or whole-chart motion. Selection holds the enlarged state after pointer leave. The bounded width/height transition is a one-shot non-compositor exception already allowed by the red lines; the exact local geometry/curve is specified in [usage-history-charts.md](./usage-history-charts.md). Corners remain 2px, bar height/baseline, categorical color tokens and heatmap intensity stay fixed, and targets do not grow or overlap. The token-chart-only selection fade follows the component entry; the heatmap selection outline and recent-week bar emphasis follow the latest component ruling, while keyboard focus retains its separate indicator. Reduced motion removes the transition while retaining immediate, visible focus/selection feedback. No other component may borrow this response.

#### Exception category: container transform (chip lifts off and grows)

- The second sanctioned motion class (added 2026-07-21, revised 2026-07-22), exclusively for composer-toolbar controls whose trigger chip anchors the panel (permission selector / model selector / the + menu):
  - **Definition**: the panel does not simply appear over the trigger — it morphs from the trigger chip's exact geometry (position / size / pill radius / pill fill), growing while **translating away as a whole**, docking on the chip's opening side with a 6px gap; closing reverses back into the chip. **The trigger chip stays visible and interactive throughout** — clicking the chip while the panel is open closes it (preserving the "tap again in place to dismiss" muscle memory). An "in-place replacement" variant (chip hidden, panel occupying its spot) was tried and retired — it loses toggle-to-close and complicates timing; do not regress to it. **Both open and close must fade as a whole, coupled with the translation** (if the frames where panel and chip overlap were opaque, the chip content would flash-hide — fade in while lifting, dissolve while shrinking back); positionless pure fade-in/out is forbidden.
  - **Parameters**: **220ms** (symmetric open/close; tightened from 300ms, finalized 2026-07-22), easing `cubic-bezier(0.3, 0.9, 0.25, 1)` (fast start, long settle); menu rows may stagger fade-in ≤20ms/row. This is an **explicit exception** to the ≤150ms baseline, confined to this category — it must not leak into other transitions. While morphing, the panel content must not scroll (a flashing scrollbar squeezes row width and jitters row ends); enable scrolling only after the animation completes.
  - **Radius interpolation**: the morph's starting radius is half the chip height (e.g. 30px chip → 15px), **never 9999px** (interpolating 9999→12 balloons the mid-frames); the end value is the container 12px.
  - **Implementation red lines**: (a) must degrade to a hard cut under `prefers-reduced-motion`; (b) temporarily disable transitions while measuring target geometry (otherwise `offsetHeight` at frame 0 of a width transition lays out at the old width and measures a false height when text wraps); (c) as a one-shot open/close animation it is exempt from the "persistent animations are compositor-only" red line (`docs/dev-rules/engineering-conventions.md` §7), but must still hold 300ms without dropped frames on low-end Windows, verified on hardware; (d) focus / Esc / outside-click / focus-return semantics are identical to §14.2 — morphing exempts nothing in a11y.
  - **Scope boundary**: only "trigger grows into panel" controls. Ordinary Dialog / ConfirmDialog / Toast / lightbox do not qualify (no chip anchor — they keep their current motion). The narrow variant (button-width expansion) is allowed only for **information-bearing expansion** (e.g. the recording red dot + timer, ≤240ms); purely decorative hover label reveal (e.g. + expanding the word "Add") was evaluated and removed — do not re-add.
- **Composer toolbar: two chrome tiers, one set shared between in-session and the create dialog (finalized 2026-07-22)**:
  - **Morphing-dropdown tier (+/permission/model)**: bare at rest (`border border-transparent bg-transparent`); the pill outline appears only on hover (`hover:border-[var(--border-default)]` + `composer-pill-bg`); selected/danger tiers tint the text only, never the fill.
  - **Persistent-tool tier (voice/send)**: permanent outline / solid CTA (voice: `composer-pill-bg` + `border-default`, hover `model-trigger-hover`, recording state `surface-chip` fill + red-dot timer expansion; send: `send-btn-*` neutral-inverse solid).
  - **In-session (default) and the create dialog (create-agent) must match verbatim**: the five shared controls (+/permission/model/voice/send) no longer fork styles by `visualVariant`; `create-agent-control-*` / `create-agent-send-*` must not be used for these five controls (they remain only for the create dialog's own Claude|Codex segmented switch and its top mode/project/branch pills). Changing any control's chrome changes both surfaces. Contract test: `newMakerCreateAgentVisualContract.test.ts`.
- **Quota-reset confetti** — the third sanctioned motion class (approved 2026-07-23), **only** for the status-bar usage chip’s full-quota reveal (updated by user decision, 2026-09-12):
  - **Definition**: the first observation of 100% remaining quota throws confetti once from the full window segment, including the first visit. Deduplicate by provider across task switches and component remounts. After that first burst, the quota must drop below 100% and return to 100% before another burst. Remaining at 100% never replays, even across scheduled cycles. Reset deadlines do not participate in this decision; official extra resets follow the same rule. Snapshot update timestamps only reject stale task data. The percentage roll keeps its own reset detection.
  - **Form** (finalized over four/five review rounds, 2026-07-23): **true parabolic toss + vanish on landing** — all particles launch simultaneously from the segment center in a ~**100° fan** (±50° of straight up) at equal speed, **constant horizontal velocity + constant vertical gravity** (decelerating up, accelerating down past the apex), so perceived speed is consistent from burst to fall; wider-angle particles fly lower arcs, travel farther, land earlier — the scatter comes from physics, not scripting. The final stretch before the ground line ends in a **short fade**: landing is fine, but lingering after landing ("corpsing") or vanishing without a fade is forbidden; the ground line jitters randomly so landing points don't queue up.
  - **Parameter red lines**: a one-shot celebration — simultaneous launch, no stagger delay; per-particle duration follows arc physics clamped to 0.9s–1.6s, total ≈1.6s (the number roll settles at 1.2s, then the last confetti falls a few tenths more; arc scale and rhythm are user-tuned, finalized 2026-07-23); ≤18 particles, 3–5px, torn down when done, never looping or persistent; particles are HTML elements animating only `transform` / `opacity` (compositor-only, engineering conventions §7; x/y split across two nested spans keeps horizontal velocity constant); colors come only from the four status-dot hue exemptions (done green / awaiting teal / thinking orange / error red), same values in both modes; must skip entirely under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
  - **Scope boundary**: this one spot only. Confetti must not leak into task completion, send success, or anywhere else — those stay on the §14.4 baseline (a new exemption requires a new entry here). Implementation: `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/status/QuotaResetConfetti.tsx`.
- **Summon-seal terminal choreography(召唤法阵终态编舞)** — the fourth sanctioned motion class (approved 2026-07-29), **only** for the plugin summon seal in `GhostSummonCard`/`SummonSeal` (the dual counter-arc "summoning circle" around the plugin avatar in user messages):
  - **Definition**: the seal's signature running animation (two gapped arcs, outer 83/17 + inner 39/61, spinning as a whole at 2.4s linear on an HTML wrapper) is a beloved product signature and is preserved verbatim. What was missing was an ending: when the turn stops, the gaps used to freeze in place and read as "stuck mid-load". The choreography gives the animation a curtain call instead of replacing it: **while still spinning, both arcs close their gaps into full circles** (600ms one-shot `stroke-dasharray` transition — permitted as a one-shot transient per the red lines above); when the turn actually issued a `ghost_call` (fulfilled), a success-colored halo ring then dilates outward once (`summon-seal-halo`, 0.9s scale 1→1.65 + fade) while a ✓ badge pops at the avatar's corner (reusing the Done semantic's sanctioned overshoot curve, same as `status-done-pop`); the spin is removed only after the circles are closed — a spinning full circle is visually static, so the removal is seamless. Semantics stay self-consistent: gap = in progress, full circle = turn finished; ✓/halo appear **only on a fulfilled call** — a cancelled/never-issued call closes neutrally with no success badge (the ring must not fake success).
  - **Parameter red lines**: close 600ms (`--motion-ease-out`; outside the duration tiers — sanctioned here, do not reuse elsewhere), halo 0.9s one-shot, tick pop 0.3s. Historic messages mount directly on the closed static frame with zero animation; the choreography plays only for a mount that actually witnessed `running` flip false. Halo/badge fill comes from the status-dot done-green exemption (`--card-status-done`); the ✓ glyph uses `--completion-badge-fg` (dark ink both modes, 5.29:1 on the done green — white would be 2.88:1, below the WCAG 1.4.11 non-text 3:1 floor). All keyframes are in the `prefers-reduced-motion` whitelist — reduced motion lands straight on the terminal frame.
  - **Scope boundary**: this seal only. The closing-ring language must not leak into other spinners or progress indicators. Implementation: `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/chat/GhostSummonCard.tsx` + `.summon-seal-*` in `globals.css`.
- **Stream-word fade(流式正文分段淡入)** — the fifth sanctioned motion class (approved 2026-08-07, ordinary-chat timing aligned 2026-08-25), **only** for streaming assistant prose in the chat message flow:
  - **Definition**: during streaming, each newly-arrived text **word** and each inline-code atom fades in over `--motion-fast` (150ms, opacity only) instead of popping in — content appears to *surface*, not *type*. This is explicitly **not** the forbidden per-character typewriter: each segment is fully rendered and positioned from its first frame; only opacity ramps. CJK is segmented per word via `Intl.Segmenter`; an inline-code chip keeps its internal structure and fades as one indivisible segment.
  - **Architecture red lines**: CSS owns the form, JS owns only the timing — `rehypeStreamWordFade` wraps words and inline-code atoms in `span.stream-word` and writes `--wf-delay`. Ordinary chat uses one **message-level continuous timeline** across render batches and Markdown chunks: new segments normally start `16ms` apart; once queued transparent wait reaches `96ms`, the step compresses to `4ms`; no segment may remain transparent for more than `160ms`. This keeps a burst from flashing in all at once without allowing a long batch to leave a visible transparent hole. Inline-code atoms and list markers borrow the corresponding prose segment's key and delay, so semantic atoms cannot overtake their text. Segments are keyed by type + stable content matching (same-position matches, text-prefix continuation, and bounded backward matching), not by document index. Render computes a candidate state; only a committed DOM render may publish it from a layout effect. Each segment keeps an absolute start time / remaining delay across re-parse and remount, so already-seen content never replays. The animation itself is a pure-opacity one-shot keyframe in `globals.css` (compositor-only). The final (non-streaming) render carries **zero** wrapper spans — the plugin only mounts while `isStreaming`.
  - **Degradation**: `prefers-reduced-motion` short-circuits in JS (plugin not mounted, no spans in DOM) *and* the CSS reduce block strips the animation — double coverage, and the CSS side is safe because `.stream-word` has no own opacity declaration to get stuck on.
  - **Scope boundary**: streaming chat prose only. Inline `code` participates as one atomic segment; fenced `pre` code blocks and KaTeX subtrees are skipped. Must not be applied to static content, titles, toasts, or any non-streamed text. Implementation: `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/chat/rehypeStreamWordFade.ts` + `.stream-word` in `globals.css`; tests: `rehypeStreamWordFade.test.ts`.
- **Session-loading wordmark sheen(会话加载字标扫光)** — the sixth sanctioned motion class (approved 2026-08-10), **only** for Desktop `BrandLoadingMark` while `MessageStream` defers its message tree during a session switch:
  - **Definition**: the active theme's official Light/Dark Cindy wordmark sits centered in the empty message viewport at 35% opacity; after a 200ms delayed-reveal threshold, one narrow neutral highlight traverses the wordmark shape. The PNG alpha channel is the mask, so motion is confined to the glyphs and never paints a panel/background. This is functional loading feedback for a measured long switch, not a decorative brand loop: ordinary sessions complete before the reveal threshold and never show it; the mark unmounts immediately when the message tree mounts.
  - **Parameters / performance**: highlight cycle 1.6s, `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`, HTML pseudo-element `transform: translateX(-120% → 350%)` only (compositor-only). The neutral gradient is the narrow §2 exception registered under “Gradient System”; it may use only `transparent` and `--text-primary`, never brand red or a component-authored chromatic value. `prefers-reduced-motion` removes both the reveal and sheen animations and shows a static wordmark; `[data-app-hidden='true']` pauses the infinite sheen via `animation-play-state` while the window is hidden.
  - **Scope boundary**: session-switch deferred-loading overlay only. No reuse for startup, streaming, tool execution, message generation, dialogs, cards, sidebars, empty states, or static branding. The standard `animate-spinner` remains the default loader everywhere else. Implementation: `components/branding/BrandLoadingMark.tsx`, `MessageStream.tsx`, and `.brand-loading-mark*` in `globals.css`.
- **Retired: mobile-download QR brand edge** — a rotating app-icon edge on the `MobileDownloadDialog` QR card was briefly registered here as a fourth (persistent) motion class on 2026-07-25 and **removed the same day** at the user's request: read as a strange ring turning behind the code. There is **no sanctioned persistent decorative motion** — the red lines above hold without exception. The card is now a bare QR (no edge, no border, no shadow, no tilt); its only motion is the linked ↔ onboarding size tween. Do not re-add. Contract test: `mobileDownloadDialog.test.tsx` → `keeps the QR card flat with no brand edge`.

### 14.5 聊天正文的可点性信号(Clickability in message bodies)

> 拍板 2026-07-30。起因:用户问「哪些是链接可以点、哪些不是，现在是不是看得不够清楚？」
> 排查结论是**两个独立缺陷叠在一起**,且方向相反——加强可点信号会放大误判,所以两者必须
> 一起修。本节是聊天正文(消息气泡 + 文件阅读器)可点性的权威口径。

**缺陷一:装饰被两种正交语义共用。** 「等宽 + 底色」既表示「这是代码/路径」(排版语义),
又被指望表示「这个能点」(交互语义),读者无法从外观反推可点性。实测数值:改前桌面可点的
`FileTargetChip` 用实色底(1.26:1),不可点的 markdown 行内 code 用半透明底(light
1.11~1.13:1 / **dark 1.26~1.28:1**)——深色模式下两者几乎相同,只能靠 hover 与指针形状
区分,等于「必须拿鼠标扫一遍才知道哪个能点」;移动端无 hover 无指针,该信号直接不存在。

**缺陷二:普通行内 code 会被误判成可点。** 行内 code 的候选判定曾挂一条宽松兜底
(桌面 `classifyMarkdownHref` / 移动 `looksLikeLocalHref`:含分隔符**或**有个点后缀即算
本地路径)。那是**显式 markdown 链接**的口径——作者写了 `[x](y)` 就是主动声明;反引号只
表示「这是代码」,不表示「这是路径」。实测 29 个真实行内 code 样本有 **21 个**成为路径候选
(`and/or`、`text/plain`、`A/B`、`n/a`、`1.2`、`array.map`、`console.log` …)。

#### 规则

1. **下划线常显 = 可点,且是唯一的交互信号。** markdown 里粗体占了字重、斜体占了倾斜、
   行内 code 占了等宽+底色,**下划线是唯一没被排版语义占用的通道**,故专留给交互语义。
   反过来:**没有下划线的一律不可点**。底色/等宽从此只表示排版含义,不再兼职表达可点
   (所以可点的路径 chip 与不可点的行内 code **共用同一个底色 token** —— 它们本来就是
   同一种排版物,差别只在那条下划线)。hover 变色与 `cursor:pointer` 降为**辅助**反馈,
   不再是主信号:静止状态下就必须能判断。

   **「唯一」是字面意思:可点态相对不可点态,只能多一条下划线,不得另外改文字颜色、
   字重或字体。** 差异越单一,「有横线 = 能点」越可信;叠三个信号反而让读者无法归纳出
   规则。参照 GitHub(2026-07-31 核对其 `github-markdown.css`):`.markdown-body code`
   **刻意不定义 `color`**、纯靠继承,`.markdown-body a` 也只有 `text-decoration`、
   没有 `font-weight`;可点与不可点的行内 code 差别就是那条横线。
   落地推论两条:
   - 移动端 `markdownPathChip` **只写 `textDecorationLine: 'underline'`**。它总是叠在
     `markdownInlineCode` 之后,于是自然继承行内 code 的压暗档 —— 压暗是「这是代码」的
     排版语义,继承它才对。(2026-07-30 首版曾在此钉 `textPrimary + medium`,那是下划线
     还不是主信号时的补偿,信号收敛后即为冗余,已移除。)
   - **正文裸写的路径点亮后保持正文字体,只加下划线 —— 两端同口径**(2026-07-31 实机
     走查后拍板)。它的未点亮态是普通正文,若点亮就套等宽,同一句里点亮的 `src/a.ts`
     与未点亮的 `src/b.ts` 会在**字体、底色、下划线三处齐变**,跳变无法向用户解释。
     两端都必须**按来源 + label 形态分三档**(判定口径同源:桌面
     `shouldRenderCodeReferenceLabel`、移动 `chatPathLabelReadsAsFileReference`):

     | 来源                          | label            | 点亮后                         |
     | ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
     | 正文裸写的路径                | (无独立 label)   | 正文字体 + 下划线,**不套等宽** |
     | 作者手写 `[README.md](path)`  | 读起来是文件引用 | 等宽 chip + 下划线             |
     | 作者手写 `[看这份规则](path)` | 散文             | 正文字体 + 下划线              |
     - 桌面端:`remarkLocalPathLinks` 给切出的 link 节点打 `data-bare-path` 标记
       (走 mdast `data.hProperties`),`MarkdownTargetLink` 见到它就跳过
       `shouldRenderCodeReferenceLabel`、直接走 `ResolvedLocalLink`。
     - 移动端:`matchBareFilePathLink` 在 link inline 上带 `bare: true`,
       `LinkPathChipSpan` 据此决定 chipStyle 是否含 `markdownInlineCode`;非 bare 时
       再过一遍 label 形态判定。**不得无条件去掉 `markdownInlineCode`** —— 那会把
       作者手写的文件名链接一起降级(2026-07-31 PR #1144 review 实捉)。
     - 作者手写的文件名链接保留 chip 是刻意的:那是作者的排版意图,与桌面一致。

2. **外链与本地文件不做外观区分**,只表达「可点」;去哪由文本自身可读性承担(斜杠路径
   vs `https://` 前缀)。
3. **聊天正文不使用 `--msg-link`。** 该 token 是主题契约(10 个内置主题各自定义,
   solarized 绿 / monokai 黄 / eclipse 青,用户导入 VS Code 主题时 `linkColor` 也映射到
   它),而移动端根本没有链接色概念。要满足规则 1+2 的「两端统一」,聊天正文必须退出这个
   token,统一为**正文色 + 常显下划线**。token 本身保留(其它界面仍在用),只是不进
   markdown 正文与用户消息气泡。
4. **候选判定:反引号不等于路径。** 行内 code 只接受真正的路径形状——带分隔符 / 绝对路径,
   或裸文件名;**不得**用「含斜杠或有个点后缀」兜底。显式 markdown 链接与正文裸路径不受此
   限(前者作者已声明,后者词法本就要求带分隔符)。
5. **无法判定时的点亮门槛按形态分级。** 适用于任何存在「无法判定」中间态的链路:移动端
   全部会话、以及桌面的**远程会话**(两者的 `fs:stat` 都会回 `unknown`)。桌面**本机**
   会话不适用 —— 那边走真实存在性检查,解析不到一律纯文本,没有中间态。

   判据是「形状是否明确是路径」,精确定义为 **绝对路径 ∨ 尾斜杠目录 ∨(分隔符 **且** 带
   扩展名)**。其中「绝对路径」= POSIX `/…` ∨ Windows 盘符 ∨ `file://`,**不要求扩展名**,
   由判据自己正面识别(`ABSOLUTE_PATH_SHAPE_RE`),后两档才落到 `looksLikeFilePath`:

   > ⚠️ **不要把整个判据写成 `!looksLikeFilePath(href)`。** 那个谓词有两条排除项是为
   > 别的用途写的 —— `URL_SCHEME_RE` 是为「别把 `https://` 当本地路径」、POSIX 分支要求

   > 无法区分,会跟着进乐观点亮档。刻意接受 —— 只影响断链这一个降级态(链路正常时
   > stat 回 `nonfile` → 纯文本),而代价的另一边是开发对话里最常见的那批绝对路径在断链

#### 正文裸路径的边界规格(两端同形)

正文裸路径走的是「在散文里用**正向正则**定位」,而不是「按空白切 token 再剥边」——
后者在中文里不成立(`改了src/App.tsx,然后呢` 整句是一个 token)。代价是必须自己保证
**命中独占它所在的路径 token**:不许从中段起,也不许把紧跟的字符截断。

PR #1144 的第 8、11、12、14 轮 review 各捉到这条规格的一个缺口(扩展名长度 / 右边界
字符 / 空格中段 / `( ) # %` 等未支持字符 + 行号后缀)。**逐个补字符类注定一轮补一个**,
故收敛成一条判据(两端 `startsMidPathToken` + `endsMidPathToken`,逐字同形):

| 侧  | 判据                                                                                                               |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 左  | 命中点前是同一 run 内的字符时,只有**白名单**字符可以紧邻路径:开括号 / 引号 / 冒号 / 列表分隔符 / `>`。其余一律拒绝 |
| 左  | 命中点前是空白时,看空白前那个 run:含分隔符**且不以扩展名收尾** → 拒绝(只跨空格/制表符,不跨换行)                    |
| 右  | 命中之后紧跟 token 字符 → 拒绝;`.` 与 `:` 本身放过(句末标点),但**跳过整串 `.`/`:` 之后仍跟 token 字符**时同样拒绝  |

关键收益:`( ) # % [ ] =` 之类**不需要枚举** —— 白名单之外一律拒绝,以后出现别的未支持
字符自动覆盖,不必再来一轮。

> ⚠️ 左侧必须用**白名单**,不能用黑名单。第 14 轮曾用「run 前缀已含分隔符」的黑名单,它
> 隐含假设「未支持字符出现在首个分隔符之后」,于是 `foo(bar)/src/index.ts`(括号在第一个
> `/` 之前)绕过去、还切出个绝对路径 `/src/index.ts`。白名单让未知字符**默认拒绝**,与本节
> 「宁可少点亮」同向。`>` 在表里是因为字面 HTML 的元素内容按既有口径仍识别
> (`<div>src/App.tsx</div>`);`=` 刻意不在表里 —— `--config=src/a.json` 因此不点亮,换取
> `docs/a=b/c.md` 不切出错误前缀 `b/c.md`。
>
> ⚠️ 右侧的标点检查必须**跳过整串**,不能只看紧邻一个字符。这一处被连续挖了三轮
> (`src/a.ts:12345678` → `:12.5` → `:12..5`),每轮多一层嵌套:只看一个字符时
> `:12..5`、`:12::foo`、`:12:.:foo` 都会因为第二个标点不是 token 字符而绕过去。跳整串是
> 为了把「再多一个标点」这条路一次封掉;句末连写的省略号(`src/a.ts...`)仍保住 —— 跳完
> 之后没有 token 字符。

两处刻意的例外,改动它们会让真实用法退化,均有用例钉住:

- **`.` 与 `:` 不进右边界字符类**:句末英文句点(`见 src/a.ts.`)与句末冒号
  (`见 src/a.ts:`)是最常见的紧随字符;把 `.` 加进去会让整条失配(SEG 含 `.`,回溯救
  不回来)。
- **「不以扩展名收尾」不能省**:少了它,`src/a.ts src/b.ts`(空格相邻的两条真路径)
  第二条会被当成「被空格截断的后半段」连坐掉。

已知误伤(显式取舍):散文里紧挨着一个「含分隔符、无扩展名」的片段时会被连坐,如
`见 /etc src/a.ts`。少点亮一条、文本仍可读,方向与本节规则 5 的「宁可少点亮一个真目录,

#### 不变量清单与对称路径(收敛检查点,2026-07-31)

PR #1144 的两轮 review 各捉到一个**同族**缺陷:「有下划线却点不动」。根因不是某一处写错,
而是**「加不加下划线」与「有没有点击行为」在各分支独立决定** —— 判据分散必然漂移。故把
不变量写死，并要求判据单点化:

> **下划线 ⇔ 可点,双向成立。** 可点的一定有下划线;有下划线的一定可点。

对称路径必须逐条成立(任何新增可点 inline 都要回到这张表核一遍):

**颜色也归这条不变量管**:可点态只多一条下划线,所以链接**不得写死颜色**,必须继承所在
上下文 —— 表头(`markdownTableHeaderCell` 用 `textSecondary`)、引用块等非正文色上下文里
写死正文色,会让链接相对周围文本除下划线之外还变色。移动端 `markdownLink` 与阅读器的
`a` 都已去掉显式 `color`。

**判据单点化**:移动端所有可点 inline 一律经 `clickableInlineStyle(styles, onPress, …)`
取样式 —— 它按 `onPress` 是否存在决定给不给 `markdownLink`,于是结构上无法造出
「有下划线却点不动」。**不要在 case 分支里直接写 `styles.markdownLink`**;路径 chip 不走
这里,它的可点性由 `ChatPathChipSpan` 的 `lit` 单点裁决(同样是一个判据)。源码级守卫见
`chatPathCandidate.test.ts` →「markdownLink 只能经 clickableInlineStyle 取用」。

#### 第二次检查点(2026-07-31,第 5 轮):`unknown` 的生命周期与门槛的来源无关性

第 5 轮 review 又出现同族缺陷,故按止损规则再做一次检查点。这轮的三条都不是「某处写错」,
而是上一条不变量**没写完整**:它只约束了「谁该有下划线」,没约束「凭什么判定可点」的两个
前提。补两条:

> **不变量 A:`unknown` 不是结论,只是「这一次没问到」。** 它不得与 `file` / `directory` /
> `nonfile` 同层缓存,必须能自愈重验;「已缓存」的判据只能是「有确定结论」。

`unknown` 一旦被当成终态缓存,叠上规则 5 的歧义门槛就会**永久**把真实路径钉死在纯文本上:
peek 有值 → 调用方跳过重验 → 链路恢复后也不再问。两端一律「确定态无 TTL 缓存 + `unknown`
落 30s 负缓存且不进 peek」:

| 端                                  | 确定态                | `unknown`                          |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 桌面 `lib/remoteFileOpen.ts`        | `verdictCache`,无 TTL | `unknownUntil`,30s,**不进 `peek`** |
| 移动 `session/remotePathVerdict.ts` | `verdictCache`,无 TTL | `unknownUntil`,30s,**不进 `peek`** |

代价是断链期间乐观点亮的引用每次重挂会先画一帧纯文本。刻意取舍:让「peek 有值」严格等价于
「有确定结论」,「把 unknown 当结论」在结构上不可表达,比省一帧重绘值钱。
(桌面侧曾把 `unknown` 写进 `verdictCache`,PR #1144 review 实捉。)

> **「自愈」必须真的会发生 —— TTL 到期本身不是事件。** 没有任何 React 依赖会因 TTL 过期而

作者写下 `[配置](package.json)` 只声明了「我想让它可点」,并不能让远端在链路断时知道它是否
存在;点亮了却点不开正是规则 1 要防的反例。判据在两端各只有一份、且**逐字同形**:桌面
`markdownTarget.isAmbiguousPathShape`、移动 `chatPathCandidate.isAmbiguousChatPathShape`;
所有入口都调它,**不得按来源硬写 `true` / `false`**(移动端曾对链接入口恒 `false`,与桌面
不对称,review 实捉)。

### 14.6 Icon-only Controls and Tooltips

- **Delivery contract for new and modified icon-only controls:** every icon-only interactive
  control has two labels: a localized accessible name (`aria-label`) and a visible `Tip`.
  Familiar glyphs, dense lists, and actions that only appear on hover are not exemptions: if
  the control has no persistent text label, users must not have to guess what it does.
- **Describe the action that will happen next.** Stateful controls say `Expand Sidebar` or
  `Collapse Sidebar`, not the vague `Toggle Sidebar`; their tooltip and accessible name
  change together. A disabled icon-only control explains why it is unavailable.
- **Do not duplicate persistent labels.** A button that already contains a visible text
  label normally does not need a tooltip. Decorative icons are silent and are not made
  focusable.
- **Tooltips supplement; they do not carry risk alone.** Destructive consequences,
  permission requests, and other information needed before acting must remain visible in
  the interface or confirmation flow.
- **Desktop action controls use the shared Radix `Tip`, not native `title`.** Native `title`
  remains acceptable for truncated persistent text, marked explicitly where the element is
  interactive. Shared icon-button primitives own this behavior wherever possible.
- **Windows system window controls are the narrow platform exception.** The shared
  `WindowControls` minimize, maximize / restore, and close buttons follow familiar Windows window
  chrome and do not require a visible `Tip`; they still expose localized accessible names. The
  maximize toggle uses a state-independent name because the Renderer does not own the native
  maximized state. This exception does not apply to Cindy-specific title-bar actions or panel
  controls.
- **Migration is incremental and guarded by surface.** Recursive regression coverage currently
  enforces this contract for app chrome, the title bar, the left sidebar and session list, and
  the right sidebar (`components/layout`, `components/sidebar`, `components/title-bar`,
  `features/cc-agent/sidebar`, and `features/right-sidebar`). Legacy feature-local controls
  outside those roots migrate when touched; their existence is not an exemption for new work.

- Current authority (post-E1D, see 15.10): `NEUTRAL_PRIMARY_EXPECTED_BY_ID` / `NEUTRAL_PRIMARY_FOREGROUND_BY_ID` (exact neutral values for primary actions) + `RED_EXCEPTION_ALLOWED_IDS` (the complete set of tokens allowed to contain red), all in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/themes/__tests__/cindyDecisionData.ts`.
- One-way ban: any token outside `RED_EXCEPTION_ALLOWED_IDS` containing `#DF0C27` / `#A61629` fails the suite.
- The pre-E1D `BRAND_RED_*` maps are retained in `cindyDecisionData.ts` only for D2T migration and are marked for deletion; their contents are archived in the decision log — do not treat them as current rules.

### 15.3 Interpolation Table (sRGB per-channel `round(A+(B-A)*t)`)

See the skin decision table §2 (design-stage working file, not in repo). The Light/Dark 20/40/65/75% shades were frozen with exact values in unit tests (`#EFEFEF/#F1F1F1/#F4F4F4/#F5F5F5`, `#2B2929/#2D2B2B/#2F2D2D/#2F2D2D`). **Superseded 2026-08**: the interpolation shades were replaced by the ladder model of the color-ramp revision (rules in 15.16, value authority `token-decision-table.md` §9); the current frozen values live in `cindyDecisionData.ts`.

### 15.4 Cross-Theme Exemptions (not covered by CINDY overrides)

- Semantic colors: `warning-accent` `#EA6B17` (finalized 2026-07-17, replaces `#FF6600`) / `annotation-accent` `#FF3B30` (image-annotation burn-in ink — exempt, do not change) / `status-bar-accent` (alias of warning orange, auto-follows).
- The status four (finalized 2026-07-17; same values both modes, all 9 themes follow with no override): running `#EA6B17` / awaiting `#19D2C1` / error (status family) `#D91F37` / done `#2AAE5B`; warning foreground `warning-fg` `#F3A115` (decoupled from Toast amber `#F59E0B` — Toast keeps its group-B status quo).
- `sidebar-draft-indicator` is a narrow semantic exception for the 8px pencil shown on non-selected sidebar rows with a composer draft or paused send queue. Light uses deep teal `#0B726B`; dark aliases `card-status-awaiting` (`#19D2C1`). Both must remain ≥3:1 against ordinary and hover CINDY sidebar surfaces after the translucent sidebar is composited over black and white wallpaper extremes (worst case at registration: `3.17:1` light / `5.65:1` dark). Rail tiles therefore use `--sidebar-item-hover`, never the inverse upgrade-button-only `--update-btn-hover`. Do not reuse the indicator token for generic awaiting states or add an active-row variant; the pencil is intentionally hidden while that task is selected.
- `focus-ring` `#417CDD` (blue — never red); diff red/green; modal scrim/shadows; `overlay-lightbox`; the four Toast colors.
- `destructive` / `search-match-bg` stay outside HSL_FORMAT_IDS coverage.
- **hljs syntax colors** (light = highlight.js `github.css`; dark = globals.css `.dark .hljs-*` mirroring github-dark) — dual-threshold ruling (2026-07-17): syntax colors ≥3:1, body text ≥4.5:1. The hljs palettes were designed for GitHub's default canvases; CINDY's code-block canvas (`surface-elevated`, since 2026-08 `#FDFDF8`/`#1F1F1F`; code block fill `perm-code-bg` `#FAFAF5`/`#191919`) sits close to default's, so marginal shortfalls are inherited, not CINDY-introduced (default is equally affected). Light: all syntax colors ≥3 — no remediation, itemized as exemptions. Dark: `[data-theme="cindy-dark"]` overrides `.hljs-section` to `#2573ec` (3.00:1 on the pre-2026-08 canvas; 3.72:1 after the darker revision — margins only improved, override retained) and sets `.hljs-punctuation` / `.hljs-tag` explicitly to `#c9d1d9` (defensive). Guarded by `cindyCodeBlockContrast.test.ts` (≥2 baseline + text ≥4.5). Full derivation: decision log.
- model-budget spectrum bar / GhostTool shimmer: explicitly exempt (neutral shimmer, theme-invariant).

### 15.5 U2 Explicit Exception (secondary-info color stays true to Figma)

- Tokens: `text-secondary` (light `#888883` since 2026-08 / dark `#6F6F6F`) / `text-secondary-cross` (light merged into the same `#888883` tier in 2026-08; was `#9A9DA3`).
- **Light side superseded 2026-08-13 (user ruling)**: light secondary info moved to `#888883` — warmed to the ivory hue (B=R−5) and raised to a ≥3.0 floor on every surface it sits on (page 3.17 / hover 3.06 / sidebar 3.06). The U2 "stay true to Figma" exemption now applies to **dark only** (`#6F6F6F` untouched).
- Measured contrast (WCAG): × surface `2.32/2.92:1`, × elevated `2.56/2.65:1`, × chip `2.41/2.72:1` — all below the 4.5:1 body-text AA. Ruling **U2 (2026-07-16): stay true to the Figma values**, readability loss accepted as a recorded explicit deviation. (Light was later re-tuned in two rounds to `#8C8E94`, finalized 2026-07-20, desktop and mobile in sync — see decision log.)
- Constraint: **never darken unilaterally** (`#686B72` was tried and rejected, kept only as an archived sample); changing the value requires a fresh user ruling (the 2026-08 light change carries one).
- Reverse-frozen test: `cindyThemes.test.ts` group ⑦ asserts the exact finalized values (light `#888883`, ruling 2026-08-13 / dark `#6F6F6F`); injecting `#686B72` must fail; update the baseline only after a user ruling.

### 15.6 HSL Format Contract

The 42 `HSL_FORMAT_IDS` must be HSL triplets (`h s% l%`, `h∈[0,360)`, grays use `hue=0`, 1 decimal place); every other token is hex/rgba. Round-trip HSL→RGB channel error ≤1. Nothing outside `HSL_FORMAT_IDS` may be written as an HSL triplet.

### 15.7 Brand Assets (icon + logo)

The new-session brand block is fixed at a 50×50px square icon + 110×37.5px horizontal logo with a 9px gap (2026-07 design). `ThemeBrandLockup` is the sole renderer. Themes swap artwork only via `theme.brand.icon/logo` — never rescale the finalized lockup; local images are cropped at load time to their alpha visible bounds (source files untouched). cindy-light uses the black-text logo (`cindy-logo-light.png`), cindy-dark the white-text one (`cindy-logo-dark.png`).

The brand block reads only `brand.icon/logo` — no compatibility with the legacy top-level `logo`, `logoScale`, or the interim `brand.mark/wordmark`; the structures differ semantically, never guess a mapping. Settings → Appearance keeps only three light entries (local theme copy, open folder, refresh) — no brand preview or asset picker. Exported standard JSON ships self-describing example paths (`icon-square-50x50px.png` / `logo-horizontal-110x37.5px.png`) so the config file documents both purpose and final display area; sources may export 2x/3x at the same aspect ratio. No extra README, no JSONC.

> The logo-asset red `#F70121` is intrinsic to the official brand artwork (the WORD MARK arrow glyph); it coexists with — and differs from — UI brand red `#DF0C27`. Logos are image assets outside the token system; keep the original color. Do not "correct" it to `#DF0C27`.

The splash wordmark is a separate asset pair (`assets/splash/wordmark.png`, white text, for DARK / `wordmark-light.png`, dark text, for LIGHT): both 459×156 (@2x) with a 229.5×78 render frame (its exact 2x full frame), and **neither carries a drop shadow** — `SplashScreen.test.tsx` asserts the absence. (Asset-size and shadow history: decision log.)

**Reserved artwork namespace — Bot avatar sentinels (Desktop registered 2026-08-17).**

- **Where**: the Bot identity mark only — `features/bots/BotAvatar.tsx`. A Bot's `avatar` field holds either one grapheme or a reserved `cindy://avatar/…` sentinel (`botAvatarIdentity.ts`). The three user-selected Cindy, Dash and LiZi preset portraits share this component and its round crop. Custom graphemes and the initial-letter fallback render over the §10 `--bot-avatar-*-bg` hue.
- **Forward compatibility**: a sentinel this build cannot resolve (artwork added by a newer client, or shipped by a future release) renders the neutral initial — never a broken `<img>` and never the raw `cindy://avatar/…` string as text. Contract test: `botAvatar.test.tsx`. Unknown sentinels retain this fallback contract; additional portrait sets require artwork-surface approval.

**Sanctioned brand surface — session-switch deferred-loading overlay (Desktop approved 2026-08-10).**

- **Where**: `BrandLoadingMark` mounted by `MessageStream` only while a session switch has committed the shell but deferred the message tree. It is centered as a pointer-transparent overlay in the empty message viewport and is eligible to become visible only after the 200ms delayed-reveal threshold. The live message tree and composer never carry the mark; once messages mount, the overlay unmounts immediately.
- **Asset / theme boundary**: use only the active theme's official Light/Dark horizontal wordmark returned by `useBrandLogo`; source aspect ratio is preserved and no custom-theme asset mapping beyond that existing hook is introduced. Brand red is intrinsic to the official artwork per the asset rule above, not authored by this component.
- **Motion / treatment**: 35% static base wordmark plus the §14.4 session-loading sheen. No character artwork, app icon, shadow, border, plate, enlarged hero composition, slogan, or additional brand copy. The single neutral mask-clipped sheen is the narrow gradient exception registered in §2; reduced motion lands on the static wordmark.
- **Scope boundary**: this approval identifies an in-progress session switch only. It is not precedent for branding streaming, running tasks, tools, cards, dialogs, sidebars, empty states, or other working-UI surfaces; those remain neutral and use the standard spinner/cadenced patterns.

**Sanctioned brand surface — conversation-share export footer (Desktop approved 2026-08-06; Mobile approved 2026-08-08).**

- **Where**: the footer of conversation-share PNG images generated by Desktop `renderer/lib/shareConversationImage.ts` or Mobile `src/session/conversationShareWebViewHtml.ts` / `src/session/ConversationShareSvg.tsx` only. The live conversation, selection mode, message stream, composer, and other working-UI surfaces remain neutral and must not display the character artwork.
- **Lockup**: Desktop uses one static 40×40px product-approved Cindy character crop (8px radius), followed by the active theme's 24px-high wordmark with an 8px gap. Mobile uses the same crop at 22×22px (6px radius), followed by an 18px-high wordmark with a 6px gap, keeping the narrower export understated. Do not append a website or regional host. The character keeps the source asset's original color and opacity without component-authored filtering.
- **Constraints**: no animation, shadow, decorative background, additional brand color, enlarged hero treatment, or alternate character composition. This approval identifies the source of an exported Cindy conversation; it is not precedent for adding mascots to cards, dialogs, tool output, or other share-adjacent UI.
- **Theme boundary**: Light and Dark use their matching wordmark assets. The same static character crop may be used in both modes because it is an exported brand asset, not a UI color surface.

**Sanctioned brand surface — mobile download dialog (approved 2026-07-25).**

- **Where**: `components/sidebar/MobileDownloadDialog.tsx` only, and only the dialog header icon (64px `resources/icon.png`). This is a promotion surface for the mobile app, so showing the app's own icon is identification, not decoration.
- **Constraints**: the color comes only from the official asset — no component-authored gradient or brand hex. The QR card itself carries **no brand edge, no border, no shadow and no pointer 3D tilt**: a 2px edge made of the scaled app icon was tried on 2026-07-25 and removed the same day (it read as a strange ring rotating behind the code — see §14.4). Do not re-add it in any form, static or animated.
- **Scope boundary**: this dialog only. Other working-UI surfaces keep the neutral treatment; a new brand surface needs a new entry here. Contract test: `mobileDownloadDialog.test.tsx` → `keeps the QR card flat with no brand edge`.
- **Reference renders** (light theme, zh-CN, @2x — `assets/mobile-download-dialog/`): [local mode](assets/mobile-download-dialog/guest-local.webp) (QR only — no account, so no permission card) · [signed in, no linked mobile](assets/mobile-download-dialog/onboarding.webp) (228px QR + permission card) · [signed in, mobile linked](assets/mobile-download-dialog/linked.webp) (132px QR + device list). Re-shoot these when the dialog's layout changes. **Stale as of 2026-07-25**: all three still show the retired brand edge around the QR — read them for layout only, not for the card's treatment.

**Sanctioned brand surface — Alipay payment QR (approved 2026-07-29).**

- **Where**: `features/billing/BillingCheckoutDialog.tsx` and `PlanChangeDialog.tsx` (`PlanChangeStatusDialog`) only. The 40px white center plate may show the 32px official `resources/icon.png` only after a QR payment payload successfully encodes at H error correction.
- **Payload / rollout**: this surface accepts only the server-issued Alipay short link. Desktop rollout is gated on the server being fully deployed and all pre-deployment QR actions having exceeded their 5-minute TTL; do not add a legacy long-Scheme or lower-error-correction fallback.
- **Constraints**: the white QR background is a scanner-contrast requirement, not a general brand panel. Do not add a border, edge, shadow, motion or other decoration to the code.
- **Scope boundary**: this approval covers the current Alipay QR payment paths only. `BillingPaymentAction` currently does not carry a provider; any future non-Alipay `QR_CODE` channel must first add provider-aware rendering rather than inheriting this mark by default.

**Sanctioned brand surface — Computer Use cursor (approved 2026-08-04).**

- **Where**: the optional agent cursor configured by `apps/desktop/src/main/mcp-integrations/computer.ts` while Cindy Computer Use actions are running. Its arrow color and bloom use Brand red `#DF0C27`; the driver-required gradient transitions from Brand red to Deep brand red `#A61629`.
- **Why the values are concrete**: the cursor is rendered by the out-of-process `cua-driver`, which cannot consume renderer CSS variables or the active theme registry. The fixed two-color brand palette is therefore identical in Light, Dark, and imported themes.
- **Scope boundary**: this approval identifies Cindy's automated pointer only. It does not authorize brand red for ordinary controls, focus/caret states, buttons, or other working UI. Cursor styling remains optional; a driver capability/policy rejection degrades without blocking Computer Use and is remembered for the current MCP session.

### 15.8 status-badge-fg

- The orange badge (bg `status-bar-accent` `#EA6B17`) has its own foreground token `status-badge-fg`: **default mirrors `accent-pure-cta-fg`** (light white / dark black — zero change for the 9 existing themes); **CINDY overrides light to `#1F1F1F`, dark to `#121212`** (near-black; dark shifted with the 2026-08 ramp — see 15.16), contrast × `#EA6B17` = **5.19:1 / 5.90:1 ≥ 4.5** (user-approved; darken toward `#000000` if a future orange fails 4.5).
- Consumers: `ContactsListPane:150` uses `status-badge-fg`; the `surface-on-card` consumers that sat on red CTAs (`RolePillDropdown:543/544`, `SkillhubDetailView:504`) moved to `accent-pure-cta-fg` (white); `surface-on-card` stays neutral-inverse (Fast toggle thumb). Registered in `cindyDecisionData` (a D2-phase addition).

### 15.10 Red-System Boundary & Neutral CTAs — current state(E1D 红色边界)

- Ordinary primary actions never use brand red — they are neutral-inverse. **Neutral button four states**: light bg `#3C3F43` / text `#FCFCFC`, hover `#2E3237`, pressed `#25282C`; dark bg `#EEEEEE` / text `#151515` (2026-08: inverse dark text shifted with the darker ramp, was `#252222`), hover `#E2E2E2`, pressed `#D4D4D4` (WCAG 10.32/15.74:1).
- Red is confined to semantic exceptions: `destructive`/delete, `error-*`, warning, diff red, status dots, and the explicit Mobile Beta-channel state badge (`betaChannelBadgeBackground/Foreground`, user decision 2026-08-25) — plus the login brand accent via `--login-brand-accent` (§16). The Desktop sidebar's Beta label is ordinary version text. The older `brand-login-*` tokens were retired with the wave4 white-canvas login and survive only as whitelist strings in `cindyDecisionData.ts` (harmless — the whitelist permits, it does not require).
- **send-btn family**: `send-btn-bg/-icon/-hover-bg/-pressed-bg/-disabled-bg/-disabled-icon` — CINDY overrides the whole family to the neutral four states + disabled grays (light `#444242`/`#585555` unchanged; dark shifted 2026-08 to `#323232`/`#464646`); defaults keep `--accent-cta-bg` with the opacity-85 hover. Whole family sits in `cindyDecisionData` REQUIRED_IDS + CINDY_EXPECTED, guarded by assertion ③.
- **Sidebar color hierarchy** (same set for light/dark):
  - Body (session titles) = `text-foreground` (= `text-primary`: light `#3C3F43` / dark `#D4D4D4`).
  - Secondary gray (leading icons at rest / timestamps / meta / group labels) = light `#888883` (2026-08, was `#9A9DA3`) / dark `#6F6F6F` (same as `text-secondary`); CINDY overrides `sidebar-muted` / `sidebar-action-icon` (HSL `60.0 2.1% 52.4%` / `0 0% 43.5%`) + `cmd-palette-item-meta` (hex).
  - Selected pill = inverse pill: `sidebar-item-active` light `#3C3F43` / dark `#EEEEEE`, foreground `sidebar-item-active-foreground` light `#FCFCFC` / dark `#151515` (2026-08, was `#252222`), border transparent. **Any foreground sitting on `bg-sidebar-item-active` must use `text-sidebar-item-active-foreground` — `text-foreground` is forbidden there** (the token defaults to foreground, so non-CINDY themes see zero change).
  - Running-state leading icons (vendor glyph / Puzzle / RadioTower / Clock) = **Thinking Orange `--warning-accent` `#EA6B17`**, breathing via `session-status-breathing`; the selected state stays orange (running outranks the inverse foreground). Mobile `statusAccent` mirrors value and priority. Persistent breathing sits on an HTML wrapper; SVG stays static (engineering conventions §7).
  - Assertions: ③ CINDY_EXPECTED locks the 4 token values; ⑦ adds hierarchy assertions (secondary gray clearly weaker than body; selected-pill foreground ≥4.5 on its fill).
- Test maps: `NEUTRAL_PRIMARY_EXPECTED_BY_ID` / `NEUTRAL_PRIMARY_FOREGROUND_BY_ID` + `RED_EXCEPTION_ALLOWED_IDS` (replacing the pre-E1D `BRAND_RED_*` maps — archived in the decision log). Assertions ⑤/⑦/⑧ enforce exact neutrals, the red whitelist, neutral contrast, and falsifiability.
- Backlog: the five R2 §4.3 Project_List deviations stay deferred (see the decision log backlog).

### 15.11 Input Caret (`--caret-accent`)

- Every editable input surface takes its caret color from the `--caret-accent` token. `globals.css` owns this globally (native `caret-color` plus the ProseMirror pseudo-caret); components MUST NOT set their own caret color.
- Value: default themes = `var(--accent-cta-bg)` (neutral inverse, follows the theme). CINDY overrides both modes to `#417CDD` (information blue, same value as the focus ring); removed from `RED_EXCEPTION_ALLOWED_IDS`, value locked by `cindyDecisionData.ts`.
- Do not wire the caret to any red token — red is not in the caret's allowed palette.
- Do not alias the caret to `--focus-ring` even though the values match: the semantics differ, and `--caret-accent` must stay independently adjustable.
- Mobile parity: `inputCaret` in `apps/mobile/src/theme/tokens.ts` carries the same value in both modes, consumed via TextInput `cursorColor` / `selectionColor`; `themeTokens.test.ts` locks it.

_(Finalized 2026-07-18 after two same-day revisions — earlier "brand-red caret" wording anywhere is void; see design-decision-log.md.)_

### 15.12 Vibrancy (frosted glass) System (macOS / Windows; finalized 2026-07-18, Windows resize backing updated 2026-08-21)

- **The only translucent-surface token**: `surface-translucent-sidebar` — CINDY light `rgba(238, 238, 233, 0.85)` / dark `rgba(5, 5, 5, 0.85)` (defaults to opaque `var(--surface)` in the default theme; zero effect on non-CINDY themes). Consumer: the left sidebar (`aside.bg-sidebar`); any future translucent surface **reuses this token by default** — no new ad-hoc rgba. The splash root is opaque `--surface` (it must fully cover the mounted UI until loading completes — ruling 2026-07-19).
- **Wallpaper-through triple pipeline — missing any one yields dead black** (verified by on-device A/B, 2026-07-18):
  1. Set the vibrancy backing **at window creation** (`bootstrap-electron.ts` / `vibrancyConfig.ts`); changing alpha via `setBackgroundColor` at runtime is unreliable. macOS uses `backgroundColor: '#00000000'`. Windows Acrylic uses the current `surface-translucent-sidebar` RGBA as its steady-state BrowserWindow backing, and the ordinary sidebar CSS is transparent on that exact platform/material combination to avoid double tinting. The material remains stable during live resize; Renderer layout must follow the changing window through CSS rather than switching the native backdrop per gesture.
  2. Under CINDY themes the **root container steps aside**: globals.css sets `.h-screen.bg-content-area` (and the splash backing layer while present) to transparent — otherwise the opaque root blocks everything.
  3. **No CSS `backdrop-filter` on the ordinary sidebar** — it renders the transparent window backing as a black box; wallpaper blur is entirely the native vibrancy material's job. macOS CSS lays the translucent tint; Windows Acrylic gets that same tint from the creation-time native backing. The sidebar peek drawer is the intentional exception because it covers application content rather than wallpaper.
- Material selected via the `XDT_VIBRANCY_MATERIAL` env knob, **code default `hud`** (user-tested). Windows: Win11+ uses `backgroundMaterial` (default `acrylic`, `XDT_BACKDROP_MATERIAL` knob — not yet device-verified); Win10 / non-CINDY fall back to opaque `--surface`.
- **No gradient overlays on translucent surfaces** — the light-red gradient layer was confirmed absent from the design and removed wholesale (2026-07-18); the splash gradient glow is likewise unimplemented (backlog, awaiting a ruling).
- The `surface-translucent-sidebar` alpha is the **only open look-and-feel knob** in the theme-frozen zone; adjusting it requires synchronized changes in three places (`cindy-light.ts` / `cindy-dark.ts` / `cindyDecisionData.ts`) with the themes suite green.

### 15.13 Cross-Platform Skin Rules(双端换肤定稿规则,2026-07-18)

The execution rulebook for subsequent desktop / mobile UI updates. Sources: the skin-docs working files (not in repo) plus the 2026-07-18 dual-platform acceptance.

#### Red boundary

- Brand red `#DF0C27` only for brand display / splash, destructive actions, running/thinking emphasis, and the list active glyph (dark uses `#A61629` for the glyph).
- Ordinary CTAs, FABs, send buttons, and confirm-style primaries are neutral-inverse: light bg `#3C3F43` / text `#FCFCFC`, dark bg `#EEEEEE` / text `#151515` (2026-08). Never brand-red these.
- The red whitelist does not include carets, focus rings, ordinary buttons, or ordinary selected backgrounds. A new red consumer must document its semantics and enter the token/test whitelist first; no component-level hardcoding.

#### Caret & focus

- All input carets (`cursorColor` / `selectionColor`) are blue `#417CDD`, equal to `permAutoAccent` / desktop `caret-accent`; same value both modes.
- Focus ring, Auto Approval, and info blue share the `#417CDD` family. Figma's older blue `#426BF2` is not adopted.
- Red-family carets are forbidden.

#### Cross-platform color isomorphism

- Mobile color semantics must mirror the desktop token decisions: the base layers (background, body, secondary info, borders) map directly from CINDY desktop semantics — never invent a parallel mobile palette for the same meanings.
- **Pending follow-up (2026-08)**: the desktop color-ramp revision (15.16) moved the desktop base layers; mobile has **not** been synced yet and still carries the pre-revision values (including comments claiming "in sync with desktop"). Until the mobile follow-up lands, the isomorphism baseline for mobile remains the pre-2026-08 desktop values; do not partially sync individual tokens.
- **`colors.border` light is a mobile-wide exception, not a homepage-scoped token** (ruling 2026-07-21, PR #266): mobile light `border` / `borderTranslucent` = `#C6C9CE` / `rgba(198,201,206,0.62)`, deviating from desktop `#DCDFE3` — desktop borders usually sit on `#F8F8F8` cards, while mobile hairlines sit directly on the `#EDEDED` background, where `#DCDFE3` reads at a nearly invisible 1.14:1; the darkened 1.42:1 is device-verified legible. The value lives in `apps/mobile/src/theme/tokens.ts` global `lightColors.border`, applying to every mobile-light hairline; dark stays `#434343`, isomorphic with desktop. `chatCodeBorder` / `sheetActionBorder` / `sheetGrabber` keep independent values and do not follow this exception.
- Mobile-only tokens carry only mobile-specific layers or geometry:

| Mobile token          | Light                    | Dark                  | Use                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `surfaceListRow`      | `#F6F6F6`                | `#312F2F`             | List project/task rows          |
| `surfaceListExpanded` | `#EAEAEA`                | `#2A2828`             | Expanded list block             |
| `activeGlyph`         | `#DF0C27`                | `#A61629`             | Leading active glyph in lists   |
| `chatCodeSurface`     | `#F8F8F8`                | `#353333`             | Chat / task code card           |
| `chatCodeBorder`      | `#DCDFE3`                | `#3C3C3C`             | Chat / task code card border    |

#### Iconography

- Session leading agent icons follow runtime identity: the Claude Code official pixel face / the Codex CLI `>_` multi-petal mark; desktop (`VendorIcon`) and mobile (`MobileVendorIcon`) share source assets (finalized 2026-07-20). Agent identity marks must not be mixed with Anthropic / OpenAI provider or model brand marks; `BrandArrow` is reserved for brand decoration.
- Model selection renders by model brand. Brand icons already replaced on desktop are reused on mobile from the same source.
- **Cross-platform action icons must match exactly (2026-09-08 owner ruling):** the same action on desktop and mobile uses the same source glyph and stroke geometry. For Lucide icons, use the same named glyph from `lucide-react` / `lucide-react-native`; a semantically similar SF Symbol or another icon family is not an equivalent replacement. Platform-appropriate size and semantic Light/Dark colors may differ, but the icon artwork must remain identical. This applies to native menus as well as custom components. Message menu baseline: `MessageSquarePlus` (add to chat), `Link2` (copy message link), `Undo2` (rewind), `Trash2` (delete message). If a native component cannot display the shared artwork, resolve the rendering approach explicitly instead of silently substituting a system symbol.
- **Mobile action-menu icon sizing (2026-09-08 owner ruling):** message, session, and file action menus use `iconSize.lg` (18 pt) and `iconStroke.regular` (2 in Lucide's 24-unit viewBox). Native menu assets follow the same logical size: 18 / 36 / 54 px at 1x / 2x / 3x; a 24-unit SVG viewBox does not imply a 24 pt display size. Keep the shared glyph geometry and scale the whole artwork. Existing compact filter/navigation menus may retain `iconSize.md` (16); `iconSize.action` (20) is the toolbar/lightbox tier, not the action-menu default. Preserve native menu row layout and touch targets when sizing the glyph.
- Send semantics use the filled paper plane `Send`, colored by the neutral-inverse CTA tokens; never a red send button or icon for ordinary send.

#### Type & layout

- List pages use card density: 20pt gutter, 60pt row height, 12pt radius, 55pt FAB. Never regress to the loose legacy list or red ordinary CTAs.
- Chat headers use the frosted / translucent glass system: prefer `BlurBackdrop` + the dedicated chat-header tokens; where blur is not wired up, use translucent solid tokens + hairline — no unverified new blur entry points.
- Sheets consistently use the sheet tokens. Restyling shared components (`SheetSurface` …) defaults to variant isolation: only the surfaces the design covered (tasksheet / `SessionActionSheet` / `SessionMenuSheet`) take the new style; ContextSheet, ModelPicker, info sheets do not auto-follow.
- Hairline separators inside expanded blocks: every row but the last; colors via tokens, never hardcoded (see the mobile-light global border exception above).

#### Process gates

- New or changed colors go through tokens — desktop via ColorRegistry / CSS variables, mobile via `ThemeColors` / `useTheme`; no hex/rgba in components.
- `hardcoded-color-audit` (`scripts/hardcoded-color-audit.mjs`) must pass before merging. ⚠ Not yet wired into CI as a required check — run it manually for now; CI enforcement is tracked as a follow-up (modularization plan P6-3'). Genuine exceptions (asset-intrinsic or platform-semantic) must be whitelisted with reasons.
- When a design mock conflicts with existing tokens, list it as "pending ruling" in the spec / PR and request a decision — never self-adjudicate or substitute a near color.
- Shared-component restyles default to variant / prop isolation. Pages, states, and platforms not covered by the mock keep the status quo.

### 15.14 Running / Collaboration Orange (finalized 2026-07-20)

- **Running breathing icons are always Thinking Orange** (`--warning-accent` `#EA6B17`, all themes): VendorIcon, SessionStatusIcon (Puzzle/RadioTower), AutomationSessionGroupItem (Clock); the selected state stays orange — priority: running > selected inverse foreground > rest. Mobile `statusAccent` mirrors value and priority (glyphColor same).
- **Collaboration menu row ON state is orange**: the collaboration item inside the composer「+」menu sits beside Goal and Plan. Its active text + UsersRound icon use `warning-accent`; the row background remains the standard `--model-item-hover`, and the OFF state stays neutral. This is an explicit carve-out from the 2026-07-17 neutral composer-menu rule for the ON state only.
- **SVG persistent-animation red line**: breathing-type persistent animation sits on an HTML wrapper (span); SVG stays static.

### 15.15 Create-Page Content Position + Titlebar Hover Discipline (finalized 2026-07-21)

- **CREATE AGENT content-group vertical position**: constant `max(96px, 28vh) + 46px` from the window top.
  Implementation = route container `pt-[calc(max(96px,28vh)+46px-var(--content-header-h,46px))]`:
  - the 268px cap is dead (a leftover of the Figma frame height — the root cause of content sitting high on large windows); 28% is device-tuned (from 25.5%);
  - `--content-header-h` is broadcast by `ContentHeaderSlot` (inside FeatureSidebarSlotProvider) through a display:contents wrapper (46px rendered / 0px hidden, same source as ContentHeader `h-[46px]`) — content stays pinned at the "header present" position with **zero jump** when selecting a project toggles the header;
  - header visibility has a single decision source = `useContentHeaderHidden` (mac + sidebar expanded + no injected content + no right-panel toggle; continues the 2026-06-11 "hide empty header" ruling);
  - guard: `newMakerCreateAgentVisualContract` locks the position formula + anti-regression assertions.
- **Hover-token discipline**: `--update-btn-hover` is exclusively the upgrade button's hover (inverse dark CTA) — **forbidden** on ordinary ghost buttons/badges (near-black `#2E3237` under CINDY light swallows text and icons; 6 misuses cleaned up 2026-07-21). Correct picks:
  - titlebar-area (ContentHeader) ghost elements → `titlebar-button-hover` (same as the ChromeActions window buttons);
  - general light hover in the content area → `--surface-hover`.

### 15.16 2026-08 Color-Ramp Revision (warm ivory light / neutral near-black dark)

> Value authority: [`token-decision-table.md`](./token-decision-table.md) §9 (full ladders, text tiers, contrast matrix, approval trail). Frozen in `cindyDecisionData.ts`; this subsection pins the rules.

- **Light** = warm ivory: page `#F2F2ED`; every surface/border is warm with **B = R−5** (single warmth constant; one sanctioned ceiling exception — pure white `#FFFFFF` stays for floating planes that need maximum lift above the near-white card, currently `ask-option-list-bg` only). Cards stay near-white (`#FDFDF8`) — card lift ≈9.4%, matching the original spec. Hover/chip tiers sit **below** the page (the white ceiling leaves no room above); the sidebar is its own plane one step darker (`#EEEEE9` at 85% glass opacity).
- **Dark** = pure neutral: page `#181818`, all layers R=G=B (zero warmth), simple parallel shift from the 2026-07 values. Known debt: near-black compression keeps only ~65% of the original perceived layer separation — recorded in [#2559](https://github.com/makecindy/cindy/issues/2559), fix is the equal-luminance ladder.
- **Text ramp (light)**: deepest emphasis `#0C0C0C` → body `#1A1A1A` (both neutral, crisp) → tertiary `#6B6B67` (warm −4) → secondary/meta `#888883` (warm −5, ≥3.0 floor) → disabled `#9D9D98` (WCAG-exempt). Warmth increases as text gets lighter; dark text tiers are all neutral (tertiary `#C1C1C1`, equal-luminance neutralized 2026-08).
- **Dual anchoring**: interactive fills that sit on the **page** anchor to the page (`surface-hover` tier); fills that sit on **cards/popovers** anchor to the card (light `#F6F6F1`, ≈6% below card — `settings-menu-bg-selected`, `perm-item-selected-bg`, `ask-badge-bg`, `cmd-palette-item-hover`, etc.). Dark exception, this revision only: `settings-menu-bg-selected` uses the menu-hover lift `#282828`, not the page-anchored `#1D1D1D` chip. `perm-item-selected-bg`, `ask-badge-bg`, and `cmd-palette-item-hover` stay on the page-anchored chip/hover values until their own follow-up. A single token cannot serve both planes after the revision; do not "unify" them back.
- **Twin sync**: every color carried in both hex and HSL forms (24 pairs) must stay value-identical; derived translucent inlines (e.g. `chat-input-border-focus` = tertiary at 30%) must be re-derived when their source moves.
- **Exempt families untouched**: `login-*` (58 tokens), `diff-*`, `error-*`, `overlay-*`, semantic status colors, shadows — per §10/§16 and `protected-tokens.ts`.
- User-tuned one-offs: dark sidebar glass `rgba(5,5,5,0.85)` (2026-08-11); light sidebar glass 85% opacity (2026-08-17, aligned with dark).

## 16. Login Flow (登录链路)

> 本节是登录全链路的设计系统规范。逐参数权威 = 同目录的 [`figma-component-spec.md`](./figma-component-spec.md)（组件 / 色板速查，nodeId 溯源）与 [`token-decision-table.md`](./token-decision-table.md)（token / 尺寸决策）——两份自 2026-07-24 起随 `docs/design-rules/` 入仓维护；`DESIGN-login`（逐屏规格）、`flow-map`（状态机）、`fidelity-matrix`（保真度验收矩阵）仍为设计阶段工作文件，不入仓库。本节不重复抄全表，只钉死设计规则与组件契约，逐参数值以 Figma 组件库及本节色板表为准。
>
> **交付状态**：**亮色** as-built 已合并入 main；**深色**为目标规格（色值经 Figma 组件库 Dark symbol 逐个核验，见 §16.1 双态表 / §16.5），token 已注册但 dark 槽位当前为 light 占位值，待实现 PR 填入真实深色值。两模式均受 §10「Light / Dark 双模式交付门槛」约束——非可选愿景。
>
> 本节独立于 §1–§15 默认皮肤与 CINDY 皮肤族——登录页是独立白底 / 深底反色体系，**不消费编辑器主题的 `--surface` / `--text-*` 等 slot**，只走本节定义的 `--login-*` token（light / dark 二态已注册于 `apps/desktop/src/renderer/themes/colors.ts`；见 §10）。`--login-*` 随基础 light / dark **二态**切换，但**不跟随具体扩展主题**（登录页只认 light / dark 模式；首次亮、后续跟随见 §16.5）。

### 16.1 视觉风格

登录页是**黑白反色**体系（亮色 = 白底墨字 / 深色 = 深底米字），与编辑器主界面解耦，亮 / 深两模式镜像同构：

- **面板 / 控件走墨黑–米白反色，深色镜像反相**：亮色白面板 `#FBFBFB` + 米白控件 `#EEEEEE` + 墨黑主按钮 `#2A2828`；深色反相为深面板 `#312F2F` + 深控件 `#2C2A2A` + 白主按钮 `#EEEEEE`。**两模式的面板 / 控件底色与文字都不出现纯黑 `#000` 或纯白 `#fff`**（`figma-component-spec §1.1`）；细描边例外——暗色主按钮 / 圆钮的 `#FFFFFF` 白边为 figma `white_button` 实测值，不受此限。
- **品牌红 `#DF0C27` 在登录画布内只用于区域徽标（旧称 Global pill，见 §16.3）与字标红元素等品牌 accent，跨模式不变**；画布外仅有 §15.10 登记的 Mobile Beta 渠道状态徽标例外。**禁止作页面背景**（wave4 改判，见 `token-decision-table §3` 对 `#df0c27` 的语义判定），不渗入面板内部（呼应 §15.10 红色边界）。画布底走 `--login-bg-base`（亮 `#EDEDED` / 深 `#1F1F1E`），红只经 `--login-brand-accent` 消费。错误红 `#D91F37` 同样跨模式不变（语义豁免，呼应 §10 豁免族）。
- **`--login-*` 调色板双态目标值** —— token 已注册于 `apps/desktop/src/renderer/themes/colors.ts`（dark 槽位当前为 light 占位值）。下表为深色实现的目标规格，经 Figma 组件库 Dark symbol 逐个核验；实现 PR 须将 dark 槽位更新为本表 dark 列的值：

品牌保护项 `--login-brand-accent` / `--login-brand-accent-pressed` 仍按原决定保留 `#DF0C27` / `#A61629`，两模式相同；尚未接管，不由本表生成。上表已接管行从 DTCG 自动生成，核验源说明保留原批准依据。

余下 token（`-control-border-disabled` / `-inverted-button-border` / `-callback-*` 等）的**亮色**值与 callback 族**双态**值见 `token-decision-table §3`、`figma-component-spec §1.1`（注意：这两份外部 spec 只覆盖亮色 + callback 族 dark，**登录主皮 dark 值以本表为权威**，原※推导值已经 Figma 组件库核验确认，本表为目标规格）；深色反相机制与 3 处组件改动见 §16.5。

- **社交圆钮深色 = 白圆**：与主按钮共用 `--login-primary-button-bg / -border`，深色自动反相为白圆 `#EEEEEE` + 白边，**圆内图标保持品牌色**（Google 彩 / WeChat 绿 / SSO），非反相（figma `white apple/google/wechat/SSO` symbol 核验）。

### 16.2 设计规则

**Desktop 登录成功回调页当前覆盖（2026-09-02）**：成功态移除「回到 Cindy」按钮，卡片收紧为 **560×500** 的内容流布局，并在底部显示本地化 3 秒倒计时；倒计时结束先移除倒计时文字，再调用 `window.close()`。失败 / Warning 保留原 **680×680** 卡片与返回操作。该条是当前产品 UX 对旧 Figma 成功态回调帧（680×680 + CTA）的明确覆盖；`figma-component-spec.md §6` 的旧节点仍作为历史视觉来源记录，现行客户端实现以本条与代码测试为准。

**Token 体系**：`--login-*` 已注册于 `apps/desktop/src/renderer/themes/colors.ts`（dark 槽位当前为 light 占位值，待实现 PR 填入 §16.1 表中的目标深色值）。组件经 `LOGIN_COLORS`（桌面 `loginDesignTokens.ts`）/ `loginColors`（手机 `theme/tokens.ts`）单点消费。**禁止硬编码 hex pair**（呼应 §10）——`hardcoded-color-audit` 守护全绿才允许合入。`--login-*` 随基础 **light / dark 二态**切换（对齐 `callback-*` 族与 §15 CINDY 皮肤族的双态做法），但**不跟随具体扩展主题**——登录页只认 light / dark 模式，扩展主题不 override `--login-*`（首次亮、后续跟随上次模式见 §16.5）。

**几何 / 布局常量**：固化在两个常量文件，数值权威 = `figma-component-spec §5.1` + `token-decision-table §4`，不按截图目测补值。

桌面 `loginDesignTokens.ts`（1819×2098 画布）、手机 `loginSkinLayout.ts`（750 设计 px，键名用 `font` / `radius` 避开 typography 守护扫描）。两端面板内坐标同源同值，手机由外层统一 `transform` 缩放。

**平台差异**：桌面 = Web renderer（Electron，Win / Mac 同套）；手机 = React Native（iOS / Android，含 phone / pad-portrait / pad-landscape）。两端同参数源、同 token 语义（手机 `loginColors` 与桌面 `LOGIN_COLORS` 同名同值），仅实现宿主不同（RN 用 `StyleSheet` + `Animated`，桌面用 CSS + Tailwind）。

- **面板 500→440 少掉的 60 去向（2026-07-29 审图拍板「方案 B」）**：新稿手机帧的面板是 **500 高**（含面板内「跳过登录」栏），而手机端已按产品决定剥离该入口、面板回 **440**、组回 **560**。少掉的 60 必须有个去处，两个候选经实机比例图审图：
  - **方案 B（采纳）**：`loginY` 取稿值 622 / 827，60 全部落到**底部留白**（90 / 175，比稿内多 60）。品牌簇的稿内顶部构图与间距完全保真。
  - **方案 A（未采纳）**：品牌簇整体下移 60（`loginY` 682 / 887），字标↔面板与底部留白**双双**回到稿值（20/30、25.65/115），代价是品牌簇整体比稿位低 60（叠加避脸上移后立绘顶 120 / 166）。
  - ⚠️ **禁止只改一半**：`loginY` 与品牌簇取自同一份稿，任一侧单独回退会让字标↔面板出现稿内不存在的间距（2026-07-28 实例：品牌簇换新稿、`loginY` 留 main 的 694 / 933 → 间距变 **92 / 131.65**，实机肉眼可见一条空白）。该组合已由 `loginSkinLayout.test.ts` 的「间距上界不变式」钉死（等于稿值，不是「小于面板顶」）。

- **SLOGAN 避脸（2026-07-27 用户审 demo 两次拍板）**：新稿原值下 SLOGAN 压在立绘脸上（像素级实测：立绘脸部 skin 连通域 x402..552 / y315..475，SLOGAN 资产 ink 5244px，双方按各自 `contain` 折算到 stage 求交 —— 长屏原值 `y=536.68` 时 ink ∩ 脸 = 290px、短屏 = 91px、中段 dh≈1400 最高 113px）。两档分别处理：
  - **长屏**：SLOGAN 下移 31.32（inner `y` 536.68 → **568**，容器 y 514 → 545.32；x / 宽高不动），底 645.29 距字标框顶 669.17 留 **23.88 ≈ 24 设计px** —— 24px 是这一档的**硬上限**，再下移即撞字标。
  - **短屏**：SLOGAN 在本档没有下移余量（底 481.17 距字标顶 487 仅 5.83），改为**立绘整体上移 27**（`y` 87 → **60**）。改后 dh ≤1450 全段 ink ∩ 脸 = **0**；dh 1500..1624 残留 3..9px（仅下巴尖，由长屏档自身落位 + 上面那条 24px 上限共同决定）。
  - **边界核对**：立绘资产不透明内容起于 y=86（上方为透明留白），短屏 `contain` 缩放 720/902 → 可见发顶 = 60 + 86×0.79823 = **128.65**，仍在 Status Bar 下沿（115.67）之下 12.98，**不侵入状态栏、无顶部裁切**；底部可见内容止于资产 y=696 且是淡出渐隐（alpha 69→21），上移后尾部由「藏在面板下 20.6」变成「露出面板上 6.4」——长屏本来就露 25，同款观感，无硬切边。

- **短屏以下（dh<1334）**：视觉区（立绘 / slogan / 字标）继续按 `v=max(0.25,(dh-600)/734)` 以 (375,0) 为锚连续压缩；功能区 680×**560** 不缩放、按**紧凑底距 18** 锚定底部并**钳到短屏档落位**：`loginY = min(622, max(0, dh-640))`。
  - **为什么是钳制、不是把锚常量改成 `dh-712`**：短屏档那 90 的底距是「面板 500→440 少掉 60 落到底部」的产物，只属于 dh≥1334；窄屏空间本就不足，若在那里也保留这 60，面板会上移压住被 `v` 压缩后的字标 —— 2026-07-29 review 实算：`dh-712` 会让 **dh∈[712,1222) 全段字标被不透明面板盖住**（dh=1000 压 40 设计px）。钳制式在 dh→1334⁻ 自然收敛到 622（边界连续），窄屏行为与 main 逐值一致。
  - **既定代价**：dh<822 时 stage 高度已不足以同时容纳压缩后的品牌簇与不缩放的功能区，字标与面板仍会交叠（dh=800 压 4、dh=700 压 90.5）——同一公式同一取值，**main 既有行为**，属「功能区优先」的取舍（Split View 320pt 窄窗等极端形态）。
  - **钳制自身的代价**：`loginY` 的斜率在 dh=1262 处由 1 变 0（值连续、斜率不连续）——dh∈[1262,1334) 面板定在 622 不再随屏高上移，底部留白由 18 涨到 90。该窗口仅 ≈37 物理px（@scale 0.52），离散的旋转 / 分屏切换基本撞不到，只有连续拖拽调窗（Android 分屏拖拽）可能感知到「面板定住」。
  - 守护：`loginSkinLayout.test.ts` 的「锚常量连续性不变式」（dh=1334 上下不跳变）+「间距不变式（短屏以下分支）」（dh∈[850,1334) 采样点面板顶不得压到字标底；最紧点在 dh=850，间距 4.96）。
- **2026-07-24「视觉 + 功能区整体上移 40 设计px」拍板已被本次新稿取代**（其产物 `loginY` 694 / 933 作废）：两档落位改取新稿自带的标注值（622 / 827），不再由「组底 + 底距」反推。**但 dh<1334 段仍沿用该拍板的紧凑底距 18（`dh-640`）**，只是额外钳到 622——理由见上条。
- **pad 两档（竖 744×1133 / 横 1180×820）本轮不动，但换稿时必须与 `loginY` 同批改**：pad 没有 figma 新稿帧，品牌簇与 `loginY` 目前都还是同一套 wave3 推导值，因此内部自洽 —— 字标底↔面板顶间距 **竖 14.84 / 横 33.88**（已由 `loginSkinLayout.test.ts`「pad 同源性不变式」钉住）。⚠️ **将来给 pad 换新稿基准时，品牌簇与 `loginY` 必须同批处理**：只改一半会原样重演 2026-07-29 那次 phone 侧的漂移（品牌簇换稿、`loginY` 留旧 → 间距变成稿内不存在的 92 / 131.65，实机可见空白）。换稿时上述不变式会先红，届时同步更新钉值并在本节记录依据。
- **~~pad 竖屏（stage 744×1133）为推导值，无 figma 源~~〔整段已作废 2026-07-28：面板不再增高，pad 竖屏几何与 `splashOffset` 全部保持 main 原值（`loginY` 621 / `splashOffset` 158），无需上移、无推导值〕**：新稿没有 pad 帧。面板增高后组底会从 1114.94 推到 1162.59 > stage 1133、触发安全区抬升压住字标，故把品牌簇与登录组**一起上移 60 × 0.794117 = 47.647 设计px**（`loginY` 621→573.353，立绘 / slogan / 字标同量上移；`splashOffset` 158→206 保持 splash 期簇位不变），三条不变量 = ① 组底仍落 1114.94、② 字标框底↔面板顶间距仍 14.84、③ splash 期簇位不变。**该值为推导，非设计源；用户 2026-07-27 接受推导，竖屏几何待设计侧回看确认**。pad 横屏（1180×820）组底 774.95 仍在 stage 内，几何原值不动。

**~~键盘停靠锚 = error 槽底（2026-07-27 拍板，移动端）~~〔已作废 2026-07-28：手机端跳过登录整体剥离，停靠锚仍为面板底，见本节末勘误〕**：停靠贴附锚由**面板底**改为**面板内 y=430（error 槽底）**——面板 440→500 后若继续用面板底，每次停靠会比改版前多顶 60 设计px（短屏更容易触发 clamped-fallback、把品牌层与标题挤掉）。**取舍**：键盘弹起时「跳过登录」槽（430..490）允许被遮挡——它不是输入链路的必需元素，收起键盘即可见；停靠引擎本身（10px 贴附 + safe-top 上限 + clamped-fallback 兜底）与悬浮相交判定锚（输入框 ∪ 主按钮）均不变。

**交互态**：hover（仅桌面）/ pressed（双端）/ disabled / loading 五态。态叠层挂伪元素（桌面 `::after`）/ overlay View（手机），**不动图标 / 文本子节点**；disabled 叠层走 `--login-disabled-button-overlay` token。hover / pressed 叠层**暗色落地前**为 figma 实测 rgba 字面值（亮色 as-built 现状）；**暗色 PR 起 token 化为 `--login-overlay-*` 二态 token**（叠层方向随模式反转，见 §16.5），此后组件内禁止新增字面 rgba 叠层。态系细则见设计阶段工作文件 `DESIGN-login §2`(不入仓库)。

**常驻动画 compositor-only**：spinner / loading 环动画挂 HTML（桌面）/ `Animated.View`（手机）外层 wrapper，SVG 图形保持静态（呼应 §14.4）；`prefers-reduced-motion` 直落静止。面板入场 handoff 动画是 §14.4 容器形变的窄变体（双端冻结 420ms 升起 + 渐显，`LOGIN_HANDOFF_TIMINGS.panelMs` / `panelInMs`）。

**Apple「Sign in with Apple」按钮**：iOS HIG 硬性要求使用 Apple 官方按钮样式，**不可皮肤化**——iOS 上 Apple 槽位保持原生 `ASAuthorizationAppleIDButton`，不套 `LoginSocialButton` 皮。这是合规底线，非视觉遗漏。其余社交圆钮（Google / WeChat / SSO）正常上皮。

**i18n**：登录文案走 `react-i18next`（桌面 `common.json` `login.*` 节）/ `loginMessages`（手机），5 语对齐 `zh-CN` / `zh-TW` / `en` / `ja` / `ko`。5 语全部翻准，不留空（空 key 静默回退英文）。

**多语言长文本与翻译长度预算（2026-07-24 拍板）**：

- **原则：登录链路里截断与省略号不可作为可见结果**。登录面板是 680×500 冻结几何（2026-07-27 改版后值）、槽位不撑高，长文案没有退路——所以约束加在**文案侧**：所有 `login.*` 文案（含 agent 代写 / 补翻的五语文本）必须言简意赅、按槽位长度预算写作。线上出现可见省略号 = 该语言文案超预算 = **文案 bug（P1，修文案，不改布局）**。
- **长度预算自检**（写 / 翻文案时逐语言过一遍）：估宽公式——汉字 / 假名 / 谚文 ≈ 1×字号 px，拉丁字母 / 数字 / 空格 ≈ 0.5×字号 px；估宽 ≤ 槽宽 × 0.95 才算过。常用槽预算：

  | 槽                                 | 宽×字号                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |         ≈汉字上限 |     ≈拉丁字符上限 |

- **agent 翻译硬约束**：为 `login.*` 生成或修改任何语言文案时，必须按上表逐语言自检；超预算就换更短表述（ja / ko 往往比 zh 长，优先压缩语序与敬语冗余），**禁止**靠布局手段（缩字号 / 加折行 / 依赖截断）吸收超长文案。
- **折行与对齐机制分级**：
  1. **单行槽**（标题 / 链接 / 倒计时 / CTA / 方式行文字）：`nowrap + ellipsis` 仅作**防御性兜底**（防极端 locale 炸版），不是设计许可——见原则条。标题类顶对齐 + 显式 `lineHeight = 槽高`（防继承行高被 overflow 裁 descender，MT-7 教训）。
  2. **说明 / 提示类**（**副标题**、输入框 hint、错误文本、游客模式说明）：允许折行但 **≤2 行 + 行数 clamp**，**顶对齐、槽高 = 行高 × 最大行数、折行只向下伸展**；禁止「固定小槽 + flex 垂直居中」——那会让超行文本上下双向外溢压到相邻控件（2026-07-24 Enterprise SSO hint 压输入框实拍事故即此模式）。副标题原属单行槽，2026-07-24 拍板改判入本级（禁省略号、完整展示，几何 540@70 对齐控件列，双端已落码）。
  3. **弹窗族例外**（迁移弹窗等独立弹窗）：卡片 flex column 允许文本撑高、按钮钉底、pill 圆角跟随——仅弹窗族，不适用登录面板。

### 16.3 组件定义

- **为什么命中区随语言自适应**：文字实际渲染宽度按语言不同（zh「跳过登录」96 设计px vs en `Skip Sign-In` 更宽），固定宽热区会在某些语言下偏窄或越界；扩张量固定、宽度 shrink-to-fit，热区随语言同步。
- **为什么放大 bounds 而不是用 hitSlop**：RN 的 `hitSlop` 不越父 View 边界（Android 界外触摸不派发），与协议 radio 同一套仓内约定（§16.4 hitSlop clamp 契约）。移动端命中区高度占满 60 槽（phone ~0.5 缩放 ≈30pt，与返回钮 60 设计px 同档），向上不侵入主按钮下沿、向下不越面板底。
- **防御性截断**：内层按钮 `maxWidth = 680` + `nowrap` + `ellipsis`（移动 `numberOfLines={1}`）仅为防极端 locale 把两侧撑出面板 `overflow:hidden` 被静默裁掉，**不是设计许可**——线上出现可见省略号 = 该语言文案超预算 = 文案 bug（P1，改文案不改布局，见 §16.2 长度预算表「跳过登录」行）。
- **focus ring**：当前与登录域其它按钮一致（未单独实现 focus 可见环），随登录域 focus 态统一处理时一并补。

**区域徽标（`LoginTitleBlock` 的 `regionPill`，桌面；figma §4.10 胶囊 h30 r40，2026-07-27 改判）**：标题右侧品牌红胶囊，`--login-brand-accent` 底 + `--login-inverted-button-border` 白字 16 Bold，inline 组内 gap 2、垂直居中于 38 行框。

- **挂哪些区域**：`cn` → `CN`；`dev` → `Dev`；**`global` 不挂**。这是产品叙事的硬规则而非视觉遗漏——Cindy 是「天生全球」的产品，默认版本不给自己贴标签自证是全球版，只有为特定法规单独构建的版本才被标注（不对称命名）。旧实现给 global 挂 `Global` 徽标，读出来反而是「存在一个本土主场版、这是它的出口型号」，与叙事相反。**给 global 恢复徽标即回退该决策，不得回退。**
- **为什么 cn / dev 仍标**：两者连的都不是 global 端点（cn 走国内端点、dev 走独立 dev 端点），登录页是用户确认自己连向哪个后端的位置；dev 另有并存场景——`CindyDev` 保持独立可执行名，可与正式包同机共存。⚠️ **不要把 cn 的理由写成「区分同机双装的 cn / global」**：2026-07-26 起两者可执行名同为 `Cindy`、安装目录与快捷方式同名互抢，该双装场景已**明确放弃支持**（见 `packages/maker-shared/src/brandIdentity.ts` 的 `executableNameByRegion` doc）。
- **宽度自适应**：由 `REGION_PILL.paddingX`（11）撑开，不再固定 70px——70 是为 `Global` 一词量身定的，`CN` / `Dev` 在固定宽里会留大片空白。11 由原几何反推（(70 − `Global` 6 拉丁字符 @16 Bold ≈ 48) / 2），保住 figma 的左右留白密度。
- **文案不翻译**：五语同文的区域代号（承袭旧 `login.globalRegion` 的做法），但仍走 i18n（`login.regionPill.*`），以便日后改判为「中国大陆版」这类可译文案时不必回改组件。
- **手机端无此变体**：`apps/mobile` 的 `LoginTitleBlock` 不接 `regionPill`（移动端未做区域徽标）。

**组件库新增（2026-07-24 登记；协议 UI 已随 consent PR 落地，游客圆钮方案已由上述「跳过登录」文字按钮取代）**：

- **协议勾选 radio**（figma `radiobutton 600:627`，四态双模式）：24×24 命中区，圈 20×20 r9 + 2px 描边，选中为**对勾**（非圆点）。亮：未选 `#F1F0F1` 底 / `#434343` 边 → 选中 `#2A2828` 实底 + 白勾；暗：未选 `#2A2828` 底 / `#F1F0F1` 边 → 选中 `#F1F0F1` 底 + `#2A2828` 勾——选中反色与登录黑白反色体系同构。用于登录页 `服务条款` 协议行。
- **服务条款弹窗小按钮**（figma `light_button_*` / `Dark_button_*` 四母版，`602:846/863/1297/1311`）：260×80 r40 文字 Bold 24；强调钮 = 模式反色（亮强调深底 `#2A2828`、暗强调浅底 `#EEEEEE`），暗模式普通钮引入新灰 `#434141` 底 / `#565454` 边。逐态值见 `figma-component-spec §11.3`。
- 既有组件扩容：`SSO 登录_企业` 与 `back` 均扩为含 Dark 三态的六态集（值已并入 §16.1 `--login-action-control-bg` / `--login-back-border` 口径），`white_button` 增 loading 五态。

### 16.4 登录链路逐屏

登录状态机权威 = `packages/auth-client` 源码（`AuthFlowState` / `LoginOutcome` 判别联合；`flow-map` 为辅助导航，个别 UI 段落滞后于区域定形态改版）。共享 step ∈ {`identifier`, `method-choice`, `verification-code`, `sso-verification`, `browser-redirect`, `account-selection`, `binding`, `completed`, `error`}（`sso-org` **不是**共享 step，是 `identifier` 下的页面局部 `ssoOrgMode` 子视图）；其中 `account-selection` / `binding` / `sso-verification` / `completed` 由服务端 `LoginOutcome.status`（`ok` / `select_account` / `binding_required` / `sso_verification_required`）分支决定，**不是固定步骤**——任意 outcome 调用都可能命中。逐屏职责与关键组件（逐屏坐标 / 文案见 `DESIGN-login §3` 国区 / `§4` 国际区 / `§5` 移动）：

「跳过登录」过门的口径（2026-07-29 拍板，**推翻 07-27 的免门结论**）：不登录账号也是在使用 Cindy 客户端，因此与个人账号登录同口径——未勾选时先弹协议弹窗，同意后才进未登录状态，并写入统计采集同意（是否真的上报另由 main 侧闸决定：`analyticsSettingsService` 对本地会话一律 `!isLocalMode()` 不放行）。协议 UI（radio 四态、弹窗小按钮）与企业 SSO 豁免均不变。

> **实现约束（合规，勿改顺序）**：这条链路上「同意记录」必须落在 `auth:enter-local` **之后**，与其它过门点（放行时刻即落）不同。原因是 `acceptPrivacyConsent` 的 IPC handler 会同步广播 `allowed = isAnalyticsAllowed() && !isLocalMode()`——提前落同意时 `isLocalMode()` 尚为 false，广播出的 `allowed:true` 会让 renderer 的 TapDB 当场 `initSdk()` 并发出 `device_login`，等 `enter-local` 完成再广播 `allowed:false` 已经晚了，「未登录态不上报」在正式包上就被破了一个窗口。落码为 `requireConsent(action, { deferConsentPersist: true })` + `openLocalMode` 自己在会话切换后落同意；顺序由 `LoginPage.consent.test.tsx` 的 `invocationCallOrder` 断言锁住（面板内入口与 `error` 步逃生口、勾选与弹窗两条路径都覆盖）。

> 同一条合规约束还要求**切换窗口内不接任何新动作**：`auth:enter-local` 的 handler 要 await `waitForSessionInvalidation()` 与 `teardownAuthAccountBoundary()`，这段窗口里 `isLoading` 仍为 false、协议弹窗已关且 radio 已勾选，邮箱 / 社交等入口仍可点——它们走「放行即落同意」分支，会在 main 还没转成 local 时再次广播 `allowed:true`。收口点是 `requireConsent` 顶部的 `localModePendingRef` guard（豁免协议门的企业 SSO 入口与 `error` 步 `reset` 另行自挡，因为它们绕过 `requireConsent`）。用**行为层 guard 而不是给每个控件加 disabled**：窗口通常只有几十毫秒，全量 disabled 会换来一次可见闪变（规则 7：无视觉跳变），而行为 guard 已杜绝 persist 与派发。guard 读 ref 而非 state——点击可能落在 `setState` 与 re-render 之间，那时闭包里的 state 还是旧值。

**协议同意行整行热区（2026-07-29 拍板）**：命中区由 radio 的 24px 圈体扩到**整行 680×40**——点声明文字或行内空白都等于点 radio。例外两类：行内「服务条款」/「隐私协议」链接各自 `stopPropagation`（只开链接、不切勾选态），radio 自身也 `stopPropagation`（否则冒泡到行容器二次 toggle，净效果为点不动）。行容器不加 `role` / `tabIndex`：radio 仍是唯一无障碍交互点（`role="checkbox"` + `aria-labelledby` 指向声明文字），整行点击只是鼠标增强；整行 `select-none`，避免连点选中文字盖住勾选反馈。

**注销状态浮层气泡（figma 678:1075「注销状态」组件集，2026-07-26 定形）**：账号注销状态**不在登录面板内**，而是登录屏根容器的 absolute 浮层——历史实现曾把它放在登录皮容器（`LoginStage`）的文档流首子位置，被 `absolute; top:0` 的不透明登录面板 100% 覆盖（`pending` / `processing` / `completed` 三态全中，修复前证据见 `docs/design-previews/deletion-banner-repro/`）；**改回面板内即重现该缺陷，不得回退**。

- **层级与布局**:不占布局流、不推挤下方内容,**允许盖住立绘与字标**(设计意图,figma iPhone 帧即压立绘 91px);桌面 `z-30`(低于顶部拖拽条 `z-40`、协议弹窗 `z-50`),移动端靠渲染序位于登录组之后、协议弹窗之前。几何按设计单位 × 登录组同一缩放系数(见下「几何」),不随键盘位移。
- **显隐**：跟随面板入场——opacity 复用登录组同一入场动画值，入场完成前不可见且不可点击（桌面 `panelHidden` / 移动端 `handoffPhase === 'done'` 门控 `pointerEvents`），避免冷启动带注销回执时气泡先于登录 UI 出现在 splash 上。协议弹窗打开时，Android 需与登录组同步 `importantForAccessibility="no-hide-descendants"`（`accessibilityViewIsModal` 仅 iOS 生效，否则 TalkBack 可穿透读到状态文案并激活「我知道了」）。
- **几何(设计单位,与登录组同缩放)**:气泡的每一个几何值都是**设计画布单位**,渲染时乘以与登录组相同的缩放系数——不是物理 px。桌面画布 1819×2098 是 2x 稿,系数 = `PANEL_FIXED_SCALE`(0.5);移动端为各 stage 的 `surface.scale`(phone = 屏宽/750,pad 见 `resolveLoginSurface`)。**2026-07-26 修正**:初版把设计单位当物理 px 直接落码,气泡在屏幕上宽了整一倍(与面板 340 并列时达 670),已按下列换算纠正。
  - 桌面:宽 670、距窗口顶 72(顶对齐固定)→ 屏幕 **335 / 36 CSS px**,与登录面板 680×0.5=340 基本同宽(设计稿即 670 vs 680);水平窗口居中;窄窗时可视宽钳制 ≤ `100vw − 24`。
  - phone(stage 750):宽 670 @x=40 → 屏幕 `670 × 屏宽/750`(393pt 屏 ≈ 351pt,左右边距各 ≈21);top 取 safe-area 顶(设计 y=116 即状态栏下沿,间距 0)。
  - pad 横屏(stage 1180×820):宽 556 = `WORD_MARK` 框宽(figma 679:1201 x=607 w=556,与字标同宽)、x=607(中心 885 与登录组中心 884.8 同轴)、top 72(底边 163 距字标框顶 177 留 14);均 × `surface.scale`。
  - pad 竖屏(stage 744×1133):宽 504(字标框宽按可见图形等比反算 269.51 × 556/297.32)、水平居中于字标轴、top 72;均 × `surface.scale`。`left` 钳制在屏内。
  - 高度**由内容撑开**,禁止固定高。
- **视觉(同为设计单位)**:圆角 22、四边 padding 20、**不透明底**(浮层压立绘必须不透明,不靠阴影 / 模糊);描边保持 1 物理 px 细线(不随缩放,否则小系数下会消失);无图标、无阴影、无动效。标题与正文同为 20 / 行高 23 / Regular 400、全部居中(长文案居中换行),仅以颜色区分层级(标题 `--login-control-text` / 正文 `--login-secondary-text`);标题↔正文 5、正文↔「我知道了」22、**「我知道了」↔气泡底固定 20**(= 下 padding,文案拉长该距不变)。内部几何由组件子元素坐标反算自洽:figma 678:1074 标题 text @(20,20) h=23、正文 @(20,48) h=23,无钮变体总高 91 = 20+23+5+23+20。
- **「我知道了」**(仅 `completed` 态):下划线文字链(非按钮)。热区按端处理——桌面用上下各 11 设计单位 padding + 等量负 margin 抵消视觉(缩放后约 22 CSS px 高,鼠标指针足够);触摸端 hitSlop **按气泡内可用空间钳制**:上 = min(18, 正文↔链接间距×scale)、下 = min(18, 下 padding×scale)、左右 20 物理 pt——RN 的 hitSlop 不会越过父 View 边界,写大了是虚标。**不设未缩放的 44pt 绝对下限**:整个登录系统按 stage 缩放(320pt 窗口下登录主按钮本身仅 ≈34pt 高),孤立保 44 必须打破「正文↔链接 22 / 底距 20 恒定」的拍板视觉;热区随系统同步缩放、在边界内取最大。
- **颜色**：底 `--login-deletion-bubble-bg`（#FFFFFF / #1F1F1E）、描边 `--login-deletion-bubble-border`（#D7D7D4 / #3C3C3A），均为**固定亮 / 暗二值**——与 §16.2「`--login-*` 只分 light / dark、不随扩展主题」一致，**不得**改用 `var(--surface)` / `var(--chat-input-*)` 等会被扩展主题 override 的 alias（同 `--login-bg-base` 的改判先例）；移动端色板逐值一致。
- **状态与文案**：`pending`（预计删除日期 + 重新登录可取消）/ `processing`（等待期结束、正在删除）/ `completed`（已删除 + 「我知道了」）三态；`cancelled` 在轮询侧拦截、不渲染气泡（改为登录后的一次性「注销已取消」提示）。五语言（zh-CN / zh-TW / en / ja / ko）× light / dark 全覆盖。

### 16.5 深色模式与主题跟随

> 深色受 §10「Light / Dark 双模式交付门槛」约束，是**必须交付**的另一模式，非可选愿景。深色色值经 Figma 组件库 Dark symbol 逐个核验（见 §16.1 双态表），为目标规格——token dark 槽位已预留，待实现 PR 填入真实值并补齐 overlay token、深色资产切换及主题跟随逻辑。落地机制如下。

**深色 = 黑白反色在深底的镜像**：面板 / 控件深底、主按钮与社交圆钮反相白、文字反相米白，几何 / 布局 / props / 状态机 / i18n **零改动**——只换色值。

**大部分组件纯 token 驱动**（补 §16.1 双态表的 dark 值即自动深色，组件不动）：`LoginPanel` / `LoginInput` / `LoginPrimaryButton`（底 / 边 / 字 + spinner）/ `LoginSocialButton`（随主按钮 token 自动反相白圆）/ `LoginBackButton` / `LoginTitleBlock` / `LoginTextLink` / `LoginMethodRow` / `LoginErrorText` / `LoginLoadingRing`。

**3 处非纯 token、需组件改动**：

1. **hover / pressed 叠层二态**：叠层原为组件内 figma 实测 rgba 字面值，暗色起 token 化为 `--login-overlay-*` 二态。**〔2026-07-24 组件库更新改判〕hover 统一「叠白变亮」**：全按钮族 hover = normal 底上叠白色半透明（深底 `#2A2828`/`#434141` 族 +白 8%；浅底 `#EEEEEE` 族 +白 10%；**唯一例外**：`back` 亮色 hover 维持既有白 70%），两模式同向——旧「白底钮 hover = 黑 5% 变暗」口径作废（figma `white_button 347:2529`、SSO `549:779` 已按新值改稿）。pressed 维持叠黑，alpha 分档：**深底强调钮 50%**（`log_in_button` 与亮模式强调小钮 `light_button_highlight`，不论尺寸）/ 暗普通小钮 `Dark_button_Normal` 20% / 浅底钮 10%（边 `#E5E5E5`）/ 方式行与返回钮 8%。归纳仅作速记，**落码逐组件对拍 `figma-component-spec §11.1` 的状态矩阵，不按类别名推断**。**〔落码状态〕本改判当前仅在文档层生效**：as-built 组件（含回调页 dark CTA / `oauthResultPage`）仍消费改判前的旧叠层值（浅底 hover 黑 5%、pressed 黑 10% 等），与新口径的同步随暗色实现 PR 的 `--login-overlay-*` token 化一并落地——在那之前「文档新口径 vs 代码旧值」的差异是已知且有意的，不构成实现缺陷；落地后以本段口径为准。hover 方向不再随底色反转，但 alpha 档位随组件底色深浅取值，`--login-overlay-*` 系列 light / dark 二态 token 照常承载，组件把字面 rgba 改为 `var(--login-overlay-*)`（机械替换，零行为变化）。
2. **`--login-bg-base` 前提变更**：画布底原为「跨主题恒定白 `#EDEDED`」，深色为 `#1F1F1E`（figma 532:585 帧实测）——即 `--login-*` 从「跨主题恒定」改为「随 light / dark 二态」（见 §16.2）。
3. **`LoginBrandStage` 资产按模式切**：深色画布用**登录专用**白字版字标 / slogan 资产（`assets/login/wordmark-dark*.png` / `slogan-dark*.png`，源自 figma 532:585 `CINDY_Standard_White` 与 SLOGAN `#FBFBFB`，由暗色实现 PR 新增；**不是** §15.7 的新页横版 `cindy-logo-dark.png`——落位与尺寸不同）；立绘两模式同资产。

**disabled 态特例**：主按钮 disabled **两模式同构**——深底 `#2A2828`（独立 token `--login-disabled-button-bg`，**不随** `--login-primary-button-bg` 反相；组件需 disabled 分支切换底/字）+ 白 70% 叠层（`--login-disabled-button-overlay`）+ 边 `#B4B4B4` + 文字 `#D4D4D4`（`--login-disabled-button-text`）opacity 0.8（figma `white_button` Disable 态核验：深色 disabled 不反相为白底，仍走亮色同款灰态）。

**双模式门槛覆盖**：深色须覆盖亮色全部态——控件 default / hover(桌) / focus / filled / active / pressed / disabled / loading / error，全部 11 屏，桌面 Win / Mac + 手机 iOS / Android（phone / pad）两端同 token 同值；`scripts/__fixtures__/login-fidelity/`（待后续补充，当前不存在于仓库中）补深色 fixture，checker 跑深色矩阵。色值以设计稿为唯一基准，1:1 还原，不引入设计稿之外的验收标准。

**主题跟随（产品逻辑）**：用户**首次**打开 Cindy → **亮色**登录界面（默认）；**第二次起** → 登录界面跟随用户上一次使用的 **light / dark 模式**（登录页只认 light / dark，不随具体扩展主题，见 §16.2）。这需要持久化「上次登录模式」+ 首次默认逻辑，超出纯 token 补范围，是一段状态逻辑，在暗色实现 PR 内一并落地。

**决策记录（2026-07-23 已定）**：(1) `--login-*`「跨主题恒定 → light / dark 二态」前提变更 + 新增 `--login-overlay-*` 二态 token——**已采纳**；(2) 深色落点 = **跟随编辑器 light / dark mode** + 上述主题跟随逻辑——**已采纳**；(3) 立绘 / 社交图标深色版——已核验（立绘两模式同资产，社交深色白圆 + 品牌色图标，见 §16.1）；本节原 ※推导值（splash 进度条 / 链接 hover / pressed）已经 Figma 组件库核验确认，§16.1 表已回填目标值。**（2026-07-24 增补）画布渐变定稿**：暗色帧红晕层（532:588/589）按 1:1 几何落地后，经实机走查拍板去除——两模式画布纯平（亮色撤渐变 = PR#104 拍板，两条决策相互独立、结论一致）；`--login-bg-gradient-*` token 保留 override 锚、值恒 `none`，红晕如需恢复须以该走查结论为基线重新与设计确认。**（2026-07-24 增补）组件库状态扩充**：hover 统一「叠白变亮」改判（本节 (1) 已按新口径改写，旧「白底钮 hover 叠黑 5%」作废）；新增协议勾选 radio 与服务条款弹窗小按钮目标规格（见 §16.3 尾注）；`SSO 登录_企业` / `back` Dark 三态、`white_button` loading 五态入库（权威逐参数 = `figma-component-spec §11`）。~~游客登录（跳过登录）样式为独立实现任务，不在本节展开~~〔**已回收（2026-07-27）**：该规格缺口已由本次改版关闭——入口定形为面板内「跳过登录」**文字按钮**（新组件类别，规格见 §16.3「登录文字按钮」；几何见 §16.2 表），游客圆钮方案与其图标资产一并退役〕。**（2026-07-24 增补·二）多语言长文本口径**：登录链路禁止以截断 / 省略号作为可见结果，文案侧按槽位长度预算约束（含 agent 翻译硬约束），说明类文本折行 ≤2 行 + 顶对齐 + 只向下伸展——规则全文见 §16.2「多语言长文本与翻译长度预算」。同日二次拍板：**副标题改判入说明类**（禁省略号、完整展示 ≤2 行，几何 540@70 对齐控件列，原 figma 单行 599@41 作废），双端已落码（桌面 `LoginTitleBlock` + 手机 `LOGIN_SUBTITLE`）。
