 * Cross-process launch fence.

 * guarantee, because the spawn does not happen here: `launchDurableRun` runs
 * inside the Pi process, in an injected extension the Host never calls. So the
 * agreement is a file both sides can see.
 *
 * Protocol:
 *  - The Host writes `{ version: 1, hostPid, createdAt }` into the shared runs
 *    directory before its first reclaim pass, and removes it on every exit from
 *    the relaunch — success or cancellation.
 *  - A launcher refuses only when the fence names *its own* host and that pid is
 *    alive. A fence from another instance sharing the agent home is ignored, and
 *    a fence whose owner died is inert, so a crashed Host can never wedge
 *    Subagent launches for anyone (including its own replacement).
 *  - The reclaim loop still runs: the fence closes the window, the loop clears
 *    whatever was already in flight when it closed.
 *
 * **Ownership is the file name.** `pi-agent-home` is shared by dev, packaged and
 * every `--passive` launch, so two instances can update at once. With a single
 * shared file the later writer overwrote the earlier one's fence and either
 * one's cancellation deleted it outright — after which the still-restarting
 * instance's own launcher read a fence naming somebody else, ignored it, and
 * spawned a runner straight through the window. Per-host names make the whole
 * class impossible: nobody writes or deletes a file that is not theirs, and the
