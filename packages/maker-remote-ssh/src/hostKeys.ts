/**
 * Host key verification (TOFU) for remote SSH connections.
 *
 * ssh2 accepts ANY host key when no `hostVerifier` is configured — unlike
 * OpenSSH, which prompts / refuses on an unknown or changed key. That default
 * leaves every connect open to a man-in-the-middle who can present their own
 * host key, then capture forwarded credentials and inject commands. This
 * module supplies the missing check: trust-on-first-use, persisted per host,
 * with a hard reject when a previously-trusted key changes.
 *
 * The store is maker-owned (a small JSON file under userData) rather than the
 * user's real ~/.ssh/known_hosts: we never mutate their OpenSSH state, and we
 * avoid the fragility of parsing the OpenSSH known_hosts format (hashed hosts,
 * bracketed non-22 ports, per-key-type entries).
